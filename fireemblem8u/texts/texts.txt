Units are divided into the[LF]
following three types:[LF]
    Player (blue)[.][LF]
    Enemy (red)[.][LF]
    Neutral (green)[.][LF]
Blue units are controlled by the[LF]
player. Red units are the enemy[.][LF]
units the player must defeat.[.][LF]
Red units will attack both blue[.][LF]
and green units, so be careful.[.][X]

## MSG_60E
Units take turns moving in[LF]
the following order:[LF]
    1. Player (blue)[LF]
    2. Enemy (red)[LF]
    3. Neutral (green)[X]

## MSG_60F
If a main character's Hit Points[LF]
are reduced to zero, the game[.][LF]
ends.[.][X]

## MSG_610
The blue area that appears[LF]
when you select a unit is[.][LF]
its movement range. Place the[.][LF]
cursor on an enemy unit to see[LF]
its movement range.[.][X]

## MSG_611
Mounted units can move again[LF]
after visiting homes or villages[LF]
if they have movement remaining.[LF]
This is most common among[.][LF]
cavaliers and pegasus knights.[X]

## MSG_612
The red area that appears when[LF]
you select a unit is its[LF]
attack range. Place the cursor[LF]
on an enemy unit to see its[.][LF]
attack range.[.][X]

## MSG_613
Each weapon type has its own[LF]
strengths and weaknesses.[.][LF]
Swords do well against axes.[LF]
Axes do well against lances.[LF]
Lances do well against swords.[LF]
This is called the[LF]
Weapon Triangle.[X]

## MSG_614
Each type of magic has its own[LF]
strengths and weaknesses.[.][LF]
Light is strong against Dark.[.][LF]
Dark is strong against Anima.[.][LF]
Anima is strong against Light.[LF]
This is called the[LF]
Trinity of Magic.[.][X]

## MSG_615
Some weapons are especially[.][LF]
effective against certain units.[LF]
These weapons will cause heavy[LF]
damage to those units. For[LF]
example, bows are particularly[LF]
effective against flying units.[.][LF]
The weapon icons in the combat[LF]
information window will glow[LF]
when your unit is facing an[.][LF]
enemy that is weak against[LF]
that weapon.[X]

## MSG_616
Critical hits inflict three times[.][LF]
the normal damage to enemies.[.][LF]
Your chance of a critical strike[LF]
changes depending on your unit's[LF]
attributes and the weapon with[LF]
which you are attacking.[X]

## MSG_617
Any attack from a weapon is a[.][LF]
physical attack. Each unit's[LF]
DEF (defense) attribute[.][LF]
shows how well he defends[.][LF]
against physical attacks. The[.][LF]
higher the number, the less[.][LF]
damage he takes. Knights and[LF]
mercenaries have good defense.[X]

## MSG_618
Any attack with magic is called[.][LF]
a magical attack. Your unit's[.][LF]
RES (resistance) attribute[LF]
shows how well he defends[.][LF]
against them. The higher the[LF]
number, the less damage he[LF]
takes. Mages, monks, clerics[LF]
& shamans have high resistance.[.][X]

## MSG_619
Restore HP to your units by using[.][LF]
vulneraries, elixirs, and staves.[.][LF]
Vulneraries and elixirs heal[LF]
only the user, while staves heal[LF]
only the units on whom they're[LF]
used. Choose your healing[.][LF]
items carefully in battle.[X]

## MSG_61A
There are five abnormal states[LF]
a unit can enter:[.][LF]
1. Sleep[LF]
(Asleep and unable to move)[.][LF]
2. Silence[LF]
(Unable to use magic or staves)[.][LF]
3. Poison[.][LF]
(Take continual damage)[.][LF]
4. Berserk[LF]
(Attack enemies and allies alike)[.][LF]
5. Petrify[LF]
(Turned to stone, cannot move)[LF]
These conditions will continue for[LF]
several turns. They can be[LF]
reversed with a Restore staff.[X]

## MSG_61B
Here is the information shown if[LF]
you choose the strategic[LF]

equipped weapon inflicts.[.][LF]
HIT: Chance an attack will land.[LF]

attack, which determines how[LF]
many attacks each unit makes.[.][X]

## MSG_61D
Any unit can rescue a blue or[.][LF]
green unit in an adjacent tile.[.][LF]
However, your constitution must[.][LF]
be higher than that of the unit[.][LF]
you're trying to rescue.[LF]
The rescuing unit suffers a[.][LF]
penalty in speed and skill,[.][LF]
but the rescued unit is[.][LF]
protected from attacks.[.][LF]
If a unit is about to lose all[LF]
of its HP, use the rescue[.][LF]
command to whisk it to safety.[X]

## MSG_61E
You can drop a rescued unit into[LF]
any adjacent tile. The dropped[LF]
unit will not be able to move[.][LF]
until the next turn.[X]

## MSG_61F
You can purchase items at[.][LF]
shops. You can also pick them[.][LF]
up by visiting villagers and[LF]
opening chests. Enemies[.][LF]
sometimes drop items when[.][LF]
they are defeated.[X]

## MSG_620
Choose an item from the item[LF]
list and press the A Button[.][LF]
to use it. Items that cannot[LF]
be used by that unit will be[LF]
grayed out.[.][X]

## MSG_621
You can trade items with units[LF]
in adjacent tiles. Select Trade[.][LF]
on the command menu, and then[.][LF]
select the unit with whom you[.][LF]
want to trade. Next, place the[LF]
cursor on the item you want to[LF]
take from the other unit's[LF]
inventory and press the A Button[LF]
to receive that item.[.][X]

## MSG_622
Items have a limited number of[LF]
uses. Each time you use an item[.][LF]
its durability goes down. The[.][LF]
number next to an item indicates[LF]
how many times it can be used.[LF]
When that number reaches 0, the[.][LF]
item breaks and disappears.[.][LF]
Be careful not to let items drop[LF]
to 0 in the heat of battle.[.][X]

## MSG_623
A supply convoy travels with[LF]
your main character. If you[.][LF]
move to a space adjacent your[.][LF]
supply convoy, you can trade[LF]
items with it. On the battle[LF]
preparation screen, you can[.][LF]
also buy and sell items at the[LF]
supply convoy. The convoy can[.][LF]
store up to 100 items for you.[X]

## MSG_624
Move a unit onto an armory and[LF]
then choose Armory to buy[.][LF]
weapons. You can also sell[LF]
items you've collected here.[X]

## MSG_625
Move a unit onto a shop and[.][LF]
then choose Shop to buy and[.][LF]
sell items, magic tomes, and[LF]
staves.[.][X]

## MSG_626
Forests and mountains give[LF]
units additional cover. When[LF]
your units are in these tiles,[LF]
enemy hit percentages will be[.][LF]
reduced. When entering attack[.][LF]
range, try to stop in one of[LF]
these spaces.[.][X]

## MSG_627
Any unit that ends its turn[.][LF]
on a fortress, castle gate,[.][LF]
gate, or throne will regain[.][LF]
some HP automatically at the[LF]
beginning of the next turn.[.][X]

## MSG_628
Move a unit to a house to visit[.][LF]
the occupants of that house.[LF]
This is a good way of gaining[.][LF]
useful information that might[.][LF]
turn the battle in your favor.[LF]
Visit houses whenever you get[.][LF]
the opportunity.[X]

## MSG_629
Move a unit to a village to[.][LF]
speak with its villagers.[.][LF]
You can gain information,[.][LF]
items, and even money from[LF]
villages, so visit them if[LF]
you have the opportunity.[.][X]

## MSG_62A
Move units onto spaces with[.][LF]
chests to open them. Chests[.][LF]
are filled with all sorts of[LF]
useful items. However, you'll[.][LF]
need a chest key or lockpicks[.][LF]
to open the chest.[X]

## MSG_62B
If you see an old snag near[.][LF]
a river, knock it over to[.][LF]
form an impromptu bridge.[.][X]

## MSG_62C
Attack cracked walls to[.][LF]
destroy them and create[.][LF]
new paths.[X]

## MSG_62D
Darkness and fog limit your[.][LF]
field of vision, preventing[.][LF]
you from seeing distant enemies.[LF]
Use thieves, torches, and[.][LF]
Torch staves to increase your[.][LF]
field of vision.[X]

## MSG_62E
These siege weapons[.][LF]
fire missiles from long[.][LF]
distances. Place an archer or[.][LF]
sniper on them to use them.[.][X]

## MSG_62F
On your quest, you will run[.][LF]
across many characters who[LF]
might join your cause. Watch[LF]
story hints carefully to find[.][LF]
who should talk to these[LF]
characters and convince them[LF]
to join you.[X]

## MSG_630
Except in rare cases, if one of[.][LF]
your units loses all of its HP,[.][LF]
it will retreat from battle and be[LF]
unable to fight again. Be careful![X]

## MSG_631
Some units have special bonds[.][LF]
between them. The longer they[.][LF]
spend in adjoining spaces, the[LF]
stronger that bond will grow.[.][LF]
Once this bond is strong enough,[LF]
the Support command will appear[.][LF]
on the command menu.[LF]
Select it to make the characters[LF]
share a support conversation.[.][X]

## MSG_632
If supportive units are within[LF]
three spaces of each other they[.][LF]
both gain special combat[LF]
bonuses. There are three levels[.][LF]
of support. The higher the level,[.][LF]
the better the bonuses received.[LF]
Support levels increase each[LF]
time units share a conversation.[X]

## MSG_633
Green units are neutral. They[.][LF]
may become allies if you speak[LF]
to them. If you move to a space[.][LF]
adjacent to a green unit, the[.][LF]
Talk command may appear.[LF]
Choose [LQuote]Talk[RQuote] to convince the[.][LF]
unit to join you.[.][X]

## MSG_634
Some enemy units will join you[LF]
if you talk to them. Move a[.][LF]
character you think might know[LF]
that enemy unit into a space[LF]
adjacent to it to see if they[.][LF]

Busy days awaited him upon his return to[LF]

gathered wherever she performed.[X]

## MSG_7FF
Marisa, the Crimson Flash[.][X]

## MSG_805
L'Arachel, Queen of Light[.][X]

## MSG_806

## MSG_808

of her dear friends.[X]

## MSG_80F

a trace, never to be seen again.[X]

## MSG_811

be a trusted and honorable king.[X]

## MSG_819
After the war, Eirika and Saleh returned to their[.][LF]
respective homes. Eirika visited Caer Pelyn[.][LF]
when she could. Eventually, she left Renais in[LF]
the care of her brother and wed Saleh. Their[LF]
daughter resembles the legendary Nada Kuya.[.][X]

## MSG_81A
Following the war, Tana and Eirika remained[.][LF]
the best of friends. They visited one another[.][LF]

as close as Eirika and Tana themselves did.[.][X]

Renais. Eirika spent her days toiling in[LF]

the two were wed.[.][X]

## MSG_824

archery to her own son and daughter.[X]

## MSG_826

and Kyle dedicated himself to his upbringing.[.][X]

## MSG_828

companion, and together, they carried the[.][LF]
mighty desert nation to great glory.[X]

and story. They lived their days in happiness,[LF]
as dearest friends and toughest rivals.[.][X]

## MSG_82A

the love between them flourished, so too did[LF]
the bond that united their two nations.[.][X]

## MSG_82C
Gerik and Tethys remained bound to no nation[LF]
and beholden to no authority. They bought[.][LF]
themselves a leisurely retirement. Gerik[LF]

found many stages on which to dance.[X]

## MSG_82D

him, although he was troubled to learn she[LF]
was clumsy at everything but fighting.[X]

## MSG_82E
Myrrh returned to Darkling Woods, but at[LF]
Saleh's request, she eventually moved to Caer[.][LF]
Pelyn. In time, the townsfolk learned to[LF]
treat her not as the Great Dragon but[.][LF]
rather as a normal girl, and she was happy.[.][X]

## MSG_82F
Master and student returned to Caer Pelyn to[LF]
study in peace. Ewan worked hard, and in time,[LF]
his power grew to rival Saleh's. As equals,[.][LF]
the two continued their studies together and[LF]
expanded their knowledge ever more.[.][X]

## MSG_830
Joshua returned to Jehanna with Marisa, where[.][LF]
she pledged service to the crown and became[.][LF]
the top swordfighter in the land. Joshua still[LF]
loved games of chance, but when it came to[LF]
Marisa, she was ever the winner.[X]

## MSG_831
L'Arachel was, in time, made queen of Rausten,[LF]
with Dozla at her side, as always. Later, Dozla[.][LF]
wept like a baby when L'Arachel was wed. His[LF]
emotional outburst is remembered as much as,[LF]
if not more than, the ceremony itself.[X]

## MSG_832
Amelia traveled to Ross's hometown, where she[.][LF]
decided to remain. Over time, the two fell in[.][LF]
love and were wed. Years later they had a son[.][LF]
who grew into a warrior. As he grew in skill[LF]
and strength, he surpassed even his father.[.][X]

## MSG_833
After the war, Ewan and Amelia set out, as[LF]
promised, on a trip around the world. Their[.][LF]
deeds along the way made small legends in the[.][LF]
regions they visited. In time, Amelia gave[LF]
birth to a daughter, and they settled down.[.][X]

## MSG_834
After the war, Joshua challenged Gerik to a[.][LF]
duel in hopes of pressing him to move to[LF]

day forward, Gerik never left Joshua's side.[X]

## MSG_835
Sisters Syrene and Vanessa returned to Frelia[.][LF]

The continent of Magvel.[A][LF]
For some 800 years, a quiet peace reigned in [.][LF]
the absence of the terrible darkness.[.][A][LF]
The Sacred Stones have been passed from [LF]

The Grado Empire, ruled by Vigarde, [LF]

[BreakTalk]
These five countries house the power of [LF]
the Sacred Stones.[A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
They are joined by the emerging mercantile [.][LF]
republic of Carcino.[A][CR][LF]
[BreakTalk]
In these times of peace, tales of past[LF]

It is now the year 803...[.][A][LF]

In an instant, the whole of Magvel is [LF]

[BreakTalk]
The Grado Empire, the largest of the [.][LF]
Sacred Stone nations,[.][A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
has invaded the kingdom of Renais under [LF]
orders from Emperor Vigarde.[A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
A longtime ally of Grado, Renais is caught[LF]
off guard, unable to mount any resistance.[A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
Grado's forces move quickly, seizing one[LF]
territory after another.[A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
Compounding King Fado's worries, his son,[.][LF]
Prince Ephraim, has gone missing.[.][A][CR][LF]
[BreakTalk]
Grado's momentum carries its armies to the [.][LF]
gates of Castle Renais itself.[A][LF]

Renais will fall...[.][LF]
It is inevitable.[.][A][LF]

King Hayden apologizes for being unable to [.][LF]
spare soldiers.[.][A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
However, he does provide Eirika with a small [.][LF]
but trusted party of vassals.[.][A][CR][LF]
[BreakTalk]
Eirika is grateful for the king's aid.[A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
Chasing rumors of her brother, she sets out [LF]
for Grado.[A][CR][LF]
[BreakTalk]
The group's first stop is the remote village [.][LF]
of Ide, which was, until very recently, [A][LF]
a part of Renais.[.][A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
Here, Eirika sees the devastation of Renais [LF]
with her own eyes.[A][LF]

Eirika and company pursue the thief who [LF]
stole her bracelet.[.][A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
Their chase leads them into the mountains,[LF]
where Bazba's Bandits pillage at will.[A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
Eirika cannot ignore her countrymen's pleas [LF]
for help.[.][A][LF]
She leads her group in search of the [.][LF]
bandits' stronghold.[A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
[X]

## MSG_8E1
With her bracelet recovered, Eirika sets[LF]
out with renewed determination.[.][A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
Passing through the ancient forest Za'ha [.][LF]
brings them close to Grado's border.[A][LF]
As they near the town of Serafew, Eirika's[LF]
fears are assuaged by the lack of troops.[.][A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
But never-before-seen terrors crawl in the [.][LF]
shadows of the trees.[.][A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
[X]

## MSG_8E2
An ominous wave of dark creatures washes [.][LF]
over the continent...[.][A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
Eirika's journey to find her brother, Ephraim, [.][LF]
grows ever more perilous.[.][A][LF]
Still, she presses on despite the danger. [LF]
Her will is strong.[.][A][CR][LF]
[BreakTalk]
The town of Serafew, located on the border [.][LF]
of Renais and Grado.[A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
The people of both countries have long used [LF]
the town as a meeting place.[A][LF]
It stands as testimony to the friendship the [.][LF]
two nations have shared these many years.[.][A][LF]
Now, however, Serafew is teeming with [LF]
Grado troops.[.][A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
[X]

## MSG_8E3
Eirika suppresses her feelings of unease [.][LF]
and continues to search for her brother.[A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
Passing through Serafew, the group crosses [.][LF]
into the Grado Empire.[A][CR][LF]
From here forward, there is no doubt that[.][LF]
they are walking through hostile territory.[.][A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
In hopes of avoiding unnecessary trouble,[.][A][LF]
Eirika and company head for a sparsely[LF]
populated region of Grado.[A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
However, it is too late. Their movements are [.][LF]
already being tracked.[A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
[X]

## MSG_8E4
Rumors say that Ephraim has been defeated [LF]
and taken prisoner.[.][A][LF]
Now Eirika must find a way to rescue her [.][LF]
brother from beneath enemy eyes.[A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
Eirika's company rushes toward Castle [LF]
Renvall, where Ephraim is being held.[.][A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
Surrounded by lakes, Renvall is a natural[.][LF]
fortress, all but unassailable.[.][A][LF]
[LF]
A lone bridge, held by the enemy, is its[LF]
only entrance.[A][CR][LF]
Eirika has only one choice.[.][A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
Eirika decides to confront Grado's soldiers [LF]
head on...[A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
[X]

## MSG_8E5
The [ToggleRed]Tower of Valni[ToggleRed] has appeared to the[LF]
east of Castle Frelia on the world map.[.][A][LF]
Once held by Grado's troops, it has become[LF]
home to a host of [ToggleRed]dark creatures[ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
Battling these monstrosities is a good [.][LF]
way for units to gain strength.[.][A][LF]
Try using the tower as a training area [.][LF]
to gain extra experience.[.][A][CR][LF]
Be aware: you cannot save your battle [LF]
preparations for tower skirmishes.[A][LF]
Once you clear a tower map, you'll have [LF]
access to the next floor.[.][A][LF]
Each floor is more difficult than the last, [LF]
so come prepared![.][A][CR][LF]
Dark creatures also may appear on other [LF]
bases on the world map.[.][A][LF]
To engage these demons in combat,[.][A][LF]
simply place the cursor on their location [LF]
and press the A Button.[.][A][CR][LF]
If the battle goes poorly and you're in [LF]
danger of losing units,[.][A][LF]

## MSG_8E6
Eirika chooses to travel by sea to the [.][LF]
theocracy of Rausten.[.][A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
Her search for a ship leads her to Port Kiris [LF]
in Carcino.[.][A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
Carcino is a young nation ruled by a council[LF]
of merchants, and it is an ally of Frelia.[A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
Carcino council leader Klimt, a staunch [LF]
opponent of Grado's imperialistic actions,[A][LF]

has pledged Carcino's support to Frelia in [.][LF]
this conflict.[A][LF]

Prince Innes also intends to pass through [LF]
Carcino on his way to Jehanna.[A][LF]

Eirika believes there is nothing to fear [.][LF]
in Carcino, but she is wrong.[.][A][LF]

## MSG_8E7
Carcino has betrayed Frelia and joined forces [LF]
with Grado.[.][A][LF]

Carcino's troops stop Prince Innes, blocking[LF]
his way to Jehanna.[.][A][LF]

With soldiers occupying the road forward and [.][LF]
back, he is trapped in a hopeless situation.[A][LF]

Eirika rushes to the prince's aid.[A][LF]

The Caer Pelyn Range...[.][A][LF]

According to Ewan, a little-known passage [LF]
to Jehanna lies there,[A][LF]

hidden within its cracked red bedrock and [LF]
knife-edged peaks.[A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
To avoid Carcino and combat, Eirika's[.][LF]
troops take the mountain path.[A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
They begin climbing higher and higher toward [.][LF]
Caer Pelyn.[.][A][LF]

Unbeknownst to the group, hordes of dark [.][LF]

Jehanna, home of dancing white sands.[.][A][LF]
This largely barren desert nation is infamous [LF]

In accordance with her husband's dying wish, [.][LF]
the beautiful Ismaire rules Jehanna.[A][LF]
[LF]
The Queen of the White Dunes governs [.][LF]
Jehanna with grace and honor.[.][A][LF]
[LF]
When he was young, her son left Jehanna.[LF]
His whereabouts remain unknown.[.][A][LF]
[BreakTalk]
After passing through Caer Pelyn, Eirika [.][LF]
arrives in Jehanna.[.][A][LF]

There, she finds the nation embroiled in [.][LF]
combat with Grado's forces.[.][A][LF]

Eirika and her allies successfully repel the [.][LF]
Grado invaders.[.][A][LF]

Still, Jehanna Hall remains under siege, on [LF]

En route, Eirika learns that the hall has [LF]

On their own again, Eirika and company flee [LF]

Colm and Neimi are childhood friends.[.][LF]
Try moving Neimi next to Colm and[.][LF]
have her [.][ToggleRed]talk[ToggleRed] to him. He[.][LF]

## MSG_9A1
Colm and Neimi have an [.][ToggleRed]invisible[.][LF]
bond[ToggleRed] that ties them together.[.][A][LF]
Units that have such a bond can[.][LF]
develop a [ToggleRed]support relationship[ToggleRed].[.][A][CR][LF]
Units become closer and their bond[LF]
stronger the longer they are[LF]
[ToggleRed]adjacent to one another[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
Eventually, they will be able to[LF]
share a [ToggleRed]support conversation[ToggleRed].[.][A][CR][LF]
Units that share a support relationship[.][LF]
fight with [.][ToggleRed]improved abilities[ToggleRed][LF]
when they are near each other.[A][CR][LF]
There are three levels of support[.][LF]
units can share: [.][ToggleRed]C, B, and A[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
Levels are gained by staying[LF]
side-by-side as much as possible.[.][A][CR][LF]
Colm and Neimi are not the only units[.][LF]
that can have support relationships.[LF]
Eirika and Seth, among others, can [.][LF]
grow close to other units as well.[A][CR][LF]
Watch how characters interact with each[.][LF]
other to guess at who might share[.][LF]
a support relationship with whom.[.][A][CR][LF]
If you have two units you think may[.][LF]
have such a bond, [ToggleRed]place them next[.][LF]
to one another again and again[ToggleRed].[.][A][LF]
Who knows: they may eventually share[LF]
a [ToggleRed]support conversation[ToggleRed].[.][A][CR][LF]
However, bear in mind that each unit[LF]
can have only [ToggleRed]5[.][ToggleRed] support relationships.[.][A][X]

The thickest hide and strongest armor[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Why should we stay in the woods?[A]
[OpenMidRight]In combat, the trees provide[LF]

The [ToggleRed]magic[.][ToggleRed] that Artur and Lute[LF]

On the other hand, it's difficult to harm[.][LF]

Magic can also be used to attack[LF]

A few days past, my mentor was [.][LF]

[OpenFarLeft]Keep him silent?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes. My mentor told me with[.][LF]
his final breath.[.][A][LF]
The emperor plans to destroy[LF]
the Sacred Stones.[A]
[OpenLeft]The Sacred Stones? Destroy them?[A]
[OpenMidRight]As you must know, the Sacred Stones drove[.][LF]

[OpenMidRight]The emperor plans to destroy the[LF]
five stones, one by one[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenFarLeft]Why would he do such a thing?[.][A][LF]
Legend says the Sacred Stones are[.][LF]
even now all that keeps evil at bay![A]
[OpenMidRight]I cannot begin to guess his motives[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
You must know, our emperor was a gentle[.][LF]
man. But one day, he changed. Utterly.[A][LF]
Before my mentor died, he said the keepers[LF]
of the Sacred Stones must be warned.[A][LF]
I tried to slip across the border, but[LF]
the soldiers spotted me[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenLeft]Is that what happened[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
What do you think, Seth?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I think we can trust no one from Grado.[.][LF]

Destroying the Sacred Stones[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Forde, how are we on[LF]
supplies and equipment?[.][A]
[OpenRight]It's not looking good.[A][LF]
Our weapons are in bad shape,[.][LF]
and we're running low on food.[A][LF]
We can probably restock at a[LF]
nearby village, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, that's not an option.[.][A][LF]
We're in enemy territory. I will not[LF]
involve innocents if I can avoid it.[A]
[OpenRight]Yeah, I knew you'd say that.[A][LF]
I mean, it's because of stuff like that[.][LF]
that we've stuck with you so far.[.][A][LF]
But eventually, we do need to face[LF]
reality. What are we going to do?[.][A]
[OpenFarRight]Word of mouth has it that the invasion[LF]
of Renais has progressed quite far.[.][A][LF]
I've heard that the capital has fallen.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]So soon[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Still, my father is in the capital,[.][LF]
and he won't surrender easily.[A][CR][LF]
Forde, Kyle.[A][LF]
Our mission here is to harry the[LF]
troops, to distract their eye.[A][LF]
Hopefully, we'll be able to give my[.][LF]
father and Eirika time to escape.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[OpenMidLeft]Kyle, have you heard anything from[LF]
Orson? I sent him ahead to scout.[.][A]
[OpenFarRight]No word yet, and it's about[.][LF]

I can confirm Grado presence at[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]I see.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][FID_Forde]
[OpenMidRight]Seems as though we've certainly[.][LF]
caught Grado's eye this time.[.][A][LF]
Should we retreat back to the[.][LF]

[OpenRight]Um[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Are you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]sure you're[.][LF]
quite sane, Prince Ephraim?[.][A][LF]
We've an entire army after us, and[LF]
you want to charge their stronghold?[A]
[OpenFarRight]Forde! Watch your tongue! This [.][LF]
is our prince you're addressing![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Kyle, please, it's all right.[.][LF]
We've heard nothing from home,[A][LF]
so what harm could a little[.][LF]
reckless besieging cause?[.][A]
[OpenFarRight]Prince Ephraim[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't worry. I haven't lost all sense[.][LF]

Renvall holds an important place in[.][LF]
Grado's national defense.[.][A][LF]
If we can get the upper hand[LF]
and take control of it,[.][A][LF]
then Grado will waste many valuable[.][LF]
soldiers trying to take it back.[A][LF]
I hope our attack proves useful[.][LF]
to my father and Eirika.[A][SendToBack]
[OpenRight]I understand what you're saying, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
can we do it with our current strength?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Every soldier in this area is[.][LF]
trying to find us.[A][LF]
The enemy has us vastly outnumbered.[LF]
Attacking the castle is a ridiculous idea.[A][LF]
If the enemy thinks the same[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
then we may have our opening.[.][A]
[OpenRight]You have a point. I'm sure Renvall won't[LF]
expect us to attack with these numbers.[.][A][LF]
Either way, we can't run forever.[.][LF]
And we're running out of supplies.[A][LF]
What've we got to lose?[.][LF]
Shall we get ready to go?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. If we don't move quickly, we[.][LF]
may never get another chance.[.][A][CR][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Yes, the true stone is. But the stone[.][LF]
in the temple is nothing but a forgery.[.][A][LF]
The real Sacred Stone of Renais lies[LF]
beneath the royal castle.[.][A][LF]
Guarding it is a powerful seal, an[LF]
infinitely complex lock of sorts.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]What?[.][A][LF]
Is this true?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. King Fado confided in me himself.[A][LF]
The Sacred Stones banished evil long ago[LF]
and possess powers beyond our ken.[A][LF]
The ancient kings of Renais felt it[.][LF]
prudent to seal ours away.[A][LF]
They feared its power could be misused.[.][LF]
They thought to remove the temptation.[A][LF]
The keys to break the seal were hidden,[.][LF]
too[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Forged into bracelets[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]The very ones that you and your[.][LF]
brother, Prince Ephraim, wear.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Our bracelets?[A][LF]
How could Father keep this a[LF]
secret from me for so long?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][LQuote]They must know nothing of the bracelets.[.][LF]
Tell them only if some great peril strikes.[RQuote][A][LF]
These were King Fado's exact orders.[A][LF]
Prince Ephraim knows nothing of the[.][LF]
bracelets' secret, either.[A][LF]
The king told me this out of fear that[LF]
something might happen to him.[A][LF]
So that, when the time came, the two of you[.][LF]
would learn the truth.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The bracelets have such meaning[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. And we are the only living souls who[.][LF]
know the secret of the Stone of Renais.[.][A][LF]
At least, that's what I was given to[LF]
believe. And yet[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][BreakTalk]

[OpenMidRight]Yet the Grado army has made it clear[LF]
that they want me only for my bracelet.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, quite clear at that[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I don't know how, but Emperor Vigarde[.][LF]
must have learned the secret somehow.[.][A][LF]
And now, his troops pursue the bracelet, and[LF]
we are no closer to knowing his motives.[A]
[OpenMidRight]He would use the bracelets to unlock the[LF]
Sacred Stone and destroy it in secret[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Perhaps.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Which means that my brother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]If he's been captured, they may have the[LF]

[OpenLeft]Uh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Grandmother, may I[LF]

This Great Dragon[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, the inquisitiveness of youth.[.][A][LF]
Come, lass, listen to my words.[.][A][LF]
The Great Dragon is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]a blessing, one[.][LF]
that watches over all mankind.[A][LF]
Why, in days long past, when the[LF]
Demon King appeared[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenLeft]Demon King? Are you speaking of the[.][LF]
legend of the Sacred Stones?[A][LF]
The hero Grado used the power of the five[.][LF]
Sacred Stones to defeat and seal away[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenRight]No, no, that's not right at all.[A][LF]
Ah, how quickly did mankind forget[LF]
its debt to the Great Dragon.[.][A][LF]
To hear the story now, one would think[LF]
humans alone brought about victory.[.][A][LF]
That is a gross mistelling of the tale.[.][A][LF]
Only through the Great Dragon's strength[LF]
could the Demon King be sealed away![A]
[OpenLeft]The Great Dragon and the Demon King[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenRight]Mankind may have forgotten its debt,[LF]
but the Great Dragon never forgets.[.][A][LF]
It watches over the bones of the Demon[LF]
King in Darkling Woods.[.][A][LF]
It keeps the Demon King's dark brood[LF]
from swarming the world of men.[.][A][LF]
The Great Dragon's vigilance alone has[LF]
kept us safe from their blind rage.[.][A]
[OpenLeft]Is that so? I'm[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I'm[.][LF]
sorry. I never knew[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenRight]Hmph. You don't need to know everything,[LF]

[OpenLeft]Yet, Grandmother, we encountered[LF]
those creatures on the way here.[A][LF]
And they have begun to appear in[LF]
the lands we live in as well.[.][A][LF]
What does this mean?[A][BreakTalk]

[OpenRight]Ah[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You have seen the effects of the[LF]
omen that has appeared in the south.[A][CR][LF]
There is an energy there that has[.][LF]
fouled the air and darkened the sky.[A][LF]
The Great Dragon left Darkling Woods and[LF]
went south to investigate.[A][LF]
We of the village wished to protect the[.][LF]
Great Dragon, and so I sent my grandson,[A][LF]
Saleh, along as well.[.][A][LF]
But they became embroiled in battle, and[LF]
the Great Dragon disappeared.[.][A][LF]
Since that time, there's been no sign of[LF]
the Great Dragon either here or abroad.[.][A][LF]
We grew worried and directed Saleh to[.][LF]
look for any trace of the Great Dragon.[.][A][LF]
I am worried that the source of that[LF]
foul energy may be responsible.[.][A]
[OpenLeft]A foul energy[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
From the south?[.][A][LF]
Myrrh said something[LF]

of the Great Dragon![A]
[OpenLeft]I-I'm sorry.[A]
[OpenRight]But if you've seen the noble Myrrh,[.][LF]
perhaps I can proceed more quickly.[.][A][LF]
You see, our Great Dragon took the[LF]
form of Mistress Myrrh in her travels.[A][LF]

the Great Dragon yourself, lass?[A]
[OpenLeft]Yes. Myrrh was with my brother.[.][A]

[OpenMidRight]That is Fort Rigwald.[.][A][LF]
It has stood unconquered for generations.[.][LF]
Its defenses are legendary.[.][A][LF]
It is the jewel of Grado's fortifications,[LF]

[OpenMidLeft]And if we don't capture it, any attack[LF]
on the capital will be pointless.[.][A][LF]
Tell me what you see, Seth.[.][LF]
Do we have the power to take it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's a daunting task.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidRight]Do you suspect the soldiers[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Anything's possible.[A][LF]
This war is a sudden thing, but Grado[.][LF]
and Renais had long been friendly.[A][LF]
Before these hostilities, our nations were[LF]
allies[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]No, closer even than that.[A][LF]
This is the emperor's war, but the hearts[.][LF]
of the people are not so swift to change.[.][A][CR][LF]

Imperial Three they call Obsidian[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]

Duessel's sympathies are sure to remain[.][LF]

He is loyal to Grado, but he has no love[LF]
of war. I'm sure he will speak with me.[.][A]

Dame Selena was a good person.[A][LF]

in which everything occurred.[.][A][LF]
One year ago, the emperor died of[.][LF]
the illness that had plagued him.[.][A][LF]
Prince Lyon was devastated. He[LF]
fell into an endless despair.[.][A][LF]
He felt unworthy to take the throne,[LF]
unable to rule without his father.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenFarLeft]He then began to look for a way to[LF]
overturn his father's demise.[.][A][LF]
He wanted to resurrect him[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenRight]Wait, resurrect him?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Yes.[A][LF]
As you know, the Stone of Grado is[LF]
possessed of[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]unique powers.[A][LF]
It was once used to seal away the Demon[.][LF]
King, and it alone held the dark one's soul.[A][LF]
It burned within with the Demon King's[LF]
rage, and we called it the Fire Emblem.[.][A][CR][LF]
Prince Lyon and a team of mages skilled in[LF]
ancient lore hoped to harness its energies.[.][A][LF]
I remember the joy in Prince Lyon's eyes[LF]
when he spoke of using it to save lives.[A]
[OpenRight]Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenFarLeft]Prince Lyon told us he intended to use[LF]
the Fire Emblem to restore the emperor.[.][A][LF]
His death had been kept from the public,[LF]
but rumors were beginning to fly.[.][A][LF]
We knew we had to hurry, before the people[LF]
learned the truth of the emperor's death.[.][A][LF]
Prince Lyon dedicated himself to research,[LF]
skipping meals, foregoing sleep[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
And then[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenRight]What happened?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I wasn't there, so I did not[LF]
witness it firsthand.[.][A][LF]
By the time I arrived, the[LF]
deed had already been done.[.][A][CR][LF]
The Fire Emblem had been[LF]
shattered, split in two.[A][LF]
One was a Sacred Stone,[.][LF]

[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][FID_LArachel]
[OpenLeft]I see unfamiliar faces among you here,[LF]
so allow me to introduce myself.[A][LF]
I am Ephraim, Eirika's brother and[LF]
crown prince of Renais.[.][A]
[OpenFarRight]I'm Princess L'Arachel of Rausten.[LF]
The pleasure is mine, of course.[A]
[OpenLeft]I'll begin by telling you of[LF]
how we've fared in our mission.[.][A][LF]
We seized the Grado capital and[.][LF]
defeated her emperor, Vigarde.[A][LF]
Grado's capital guard have, to a man,[.][LF]
surrendered and laid down their arms.[.][A][LF]
Pockets of resistance remain, but the[.][LF]
war itself is over.[.][A]
[OpenRight]Is that so?[.][A]
[OpenLeft]However, something remains that[.][LF]
still bothers me.[.][A][LF]
A Grado man named Knoll told me about[.][LF]
something called a [LQuote]Dark Stone.[RQuote][A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[OpenLeft]Their mages had uncovered lore that led[.][LF]
them to craft a powerful magic stone.[.][A][LF]
This Dark Stone may have been the[.][LF]
catalyst of Grado's transformation.[.][A][LF]
It seems to be the source of that black[.][LF]
wave of energy Myrrh described.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[OpenLeft]Vigarde died some time ago, but the power[.][LF]
of the stone played him like a puppet.[A][LF]
The war and everything that passed since[LF]
was planned by the Dark Stone's master.[.][A]
[OpenRight]Well? Who is it?[A][BreakTalk]

[OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I still can't believe it,[.][LF]
but I'll tell you nonetheless.[A][LF]
According to Knoll, the man behind[LF]
this is Lyon, the imperial prince.[A][LF]
He said Lyon's got the Dark Stone.[A]
[OpenRight]Figures it's Prince Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenFarLeft]No, that doesn't make any sense.[A][LF]
Ephraim and I know Lyon better than[.][LF]
that. We've been friends for years.[.][A][LF]
Lyon's not the sort of person who[.][LF]
could start a war like this.[A]
[OpenRight]But, Eirika[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenFarLeft]I saw Lyon recently.[A][LF]
Ephraim, you might know this, but after[.][LF]
I abandoned the sea route to Rausten,[.][A][LF]
I traveled overland with Prince[.][LF]
Innes to Jehanna.[.][A][LF]
We ran into trouble with Grado's[LF]
forces, and I chanced upon Lyon.[A][LF]
He didn't share the details of his[LF]
situation, but he intimated that[A][LF]
he was on our side. Despite all[.][LF]
appearances, he was on our side.[A][LF]
So Lyon[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenLeft]Eirika,[.][LF]
I also met Lyon.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Did you really?[.][A]
[OpenLeft]Yes. But, he was like a[.][LF]
completely different person.[A][LF]
To be honest, he didn't seem[LF]
to be completely[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]human.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
What are you saying?[A]
[OpenLeft]I'll tell you what I saw.[.][A][LF]
I found Lyon inside Grado Keep.[.][A][LF]
This is what he told me:[LF]
He said he was behind this war.[.][A][LF]
He said he'd befriended us solely so that,[LF]
one day, he could invade Renais[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
He told me he killed our father.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]That[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]That can't[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenLeft]I know. I can't believe it either.[LF]
I refuse to believe it.[.][A][LF]
How could he have planned all[.][LF]
this since he was a child[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I simply can't fathom it.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][X]

## MSG_B2A
[OpenLeft]I've heard Lyon changed when he acquired[LF]
the Dark Stone.[.][A][LF]
I've no interest in magic, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
There was something uncanny about him.[A][LF]
It seemed almost as though he were being[LF]
controlled by something himself.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenRight]The two of you might find this hard[.][LF]
to accept, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
The state of Prince Lyon's heart matters[LF]
little. He has the Dark Stone.[A][LF]
That rock is the cause of all that's[LF]
happened. The prince must be stopped.[.][A][BreakTalk]

[OpenFarRight]Not yet. There is something[.][LF]
that needs doing first.[.][A]
[OpenFarLeft]L'Arachel?[A]
[OpenFarRight]Prince Ephraim, I do believe you[LF]
felt it as well.[A][LF]
The Dark Stone held by Prince Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
It exudes a malefic miasma[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
We might be able to handle Prince Lyon[LF]
alone, but that stone is beyond our ken.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Then what do you suggest?[.][A]
[OpenFarRight]The Sacred Stones.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]The Sacred Stones?[A]
[OpenFarRight]We've all heard the legend of the[.][LF]
five Sacred Stones.[.][A][LF]
They alone possessed the power to[.][LF]
seal the Demon King away forever.[.][A][LF]
So, of course, to dispel demonic[LF]
magic, we must use the Sacred Stones![.][A]
[OpenRight]You expect us to pin the outcome[LF]
of this war on some fool legend?[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Not just the legend.[LF]
We also have hope.[A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[OpenLeft]According to Lyon,[A][LF]
he has already seen to the destruction of[.][LF]
Grado's, Frelia's, and Jehanna's stones.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Hm. That explains something[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Grado forces attacked me, intent on[.][LF]
destroying the Stone of Renais.[.][A][LF]
If that could be the reason they[LF]
chose to invade Renais[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
The power of the Sacred Stones may[LF]
be greater than we'd ever known.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Yes, exactly![.][A][LF]
If we acquire a Sacred Stone, we'll be[LF]
able to oppose the Dark Stone's might![A]
[OpenRight]But three of the stones have been[.][LF]
shattered, and our options are few.[.][A][LF]
Do you suppose that, during the[.][LF]
invasion of Renais[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenLeft]No, I don't think so.[.][A][LF]
The Stone of Renais is hidden by the[LF]
power of Eirika's and my bracelets.[.][A]
[OpenFarLeft]Grado has made many attempts[LF]
to take our bracelets.[A][LF]
Every one has failed, and so[LF]
the stone may still be safe.[A]
[OpenLeft]We have to confirm that, of course.[.][A][LF]
We've defeated Grado, and we must[.][LF]
turn our eyes to our homeland.[A][LF]
It's time to return to Renais.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft]L'Arachel[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
May I ask your advice?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What is it, Eirika?[.][LF]
There's no need to be so formal.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's about Lyon[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CR][LF]
My brother was right. Lyon's been[.][LF]
possessed by the Demon King.[A][LF]
He[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]He's no longer the Lyon[.][LF]
I once knew.[A][LF]
But I can't help feeling[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]there[.][LF]
must be some way to bring him back.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidLeft]Please help me, L'Arachel.[LF]
I want to save him.[.][A][LF]
Rausten is the spiritual heart of[.][LF]
Magvel. They keep the ancient lore.[.][A][LF]
You're their princess. You must know[LF]
something about the demons of legend.[.][A][LF]
Is there anything that can save Lyon?[.][A][BreakTalk]

[OpenMidRight]I'm so sorry, Eirika.[.][A][LF]
To the best of my knowledge,[LF]
there is no way to aid him.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]That can't be![A][LF]
There must be something![LF]
Any clue, no matter how slight[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][BreakTalk]

[OpenMidRight]Our oldest legends tell us just this[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Only one person has ever been able to[.][LF]
shake off the Demon King's domination.[A][LF]
Rausten's founder, Saint Latona the[.][LF]
sure-hearted, shattered his fetters.[A][LF]
If one possesses a strength of will[.][LF]
beyond that of normal men[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Only then can one throw off the[.][LF]
shackles of the Demon King.[.][A][CR][LF]
But you saw it for yourself, Eirika,[LF]
with your own two eyes.[.][A][LF]
Your friend Lyon's body has already[.][LF]
been claimed by the Demon King.[.][A][LF]
Once it's gone that far, [.][.....]there's[.][LF]
nothing that can be done.[.][A][LF]
When the Demon King takes over someone,[.][LF]
he devours his spirit, his very soul.[.][A][LF]
Even if his hold on Lyon's body could be[LF]
released, that body would have no soul.[.][A][LF]
There is no power in Rausten[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]not[.][LF]
even the Sacred Stone[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
that can perform so great a miracle[.][LF]
as to restore a shattered soul.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I understand how you feel,[LF]
but the prince is gone.[.][A][LF]
The Lyon you knew no longer[.][LF]
exists.[.][A][CR][LF]
It's more important now that[LF]
you care for yourself.[A][LF]
If we pursue the Demon King,[LF]
we're likely to suffer for it.[A][LF]
I want you to return to Rausten[.][LF]
Palace and rest yourself.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, L'Arachel.[.][A][LF]
However, I must stay with[.][LF]
the company.[A][LF]
I have to believe there's something[.][LF]
I can do to help him.[.][A][LF]
Lyon was always so kind. He wanted[LF]
nothing more than to help people.[.][A][LF]
It's too terrible to picture him[LF]
imprisoned by the Demon King.[.][A][LF]
Imprisoned[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]with no hope[LF]
of salvation.[.][A][X]

[OpenMidRight]My apologies, but this was a personal[.][LF]
order from the prince himself.[A][LF]
He said, [LQuote]I don't need you loafing[LF]
around here. Go keep Eirika safe.[RQuote][A][LF]
Since when is battling all of Grado[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]You're right! My brother's mission[LF]

[OpenMidRight]There's no cause for worry, Lady Eirika.[A][LF]
We know firsthand of the prince's[.][LF]
tenacity.[.][A][LF]
No matter how close death comes, the Pale[.][LF]
Horse will not catch him.[.][A][LF]
And while it's not the same as having me[LF]

She spoke to each of us individually. She[.][LF]
knelt before us and beseeched us to go.[.][A][LF]
Her sincerity, her concern[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]We could[LF]
not help but be moved by her plea.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Very well. You will all[.][LF]

But steel yourselves. This will[.][LF]
not be an easy journey.[.][A][LF]

If Lyon were here with us, what[.][LF]
do you think he would want?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]What he would want?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes. You see, I think I know.[.][LF]
It was the reason for his studies.[A][LF]
It's why he wanted to know about the[LF]
Sacred Stones[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]or rather the Fire Emblem.[A][LF]
Let's take Lyon's dreams and fulfill[LF]
them in his stead.[A][LF]
We can do that, can't we? Without[.][LF]
relying on any mystic power?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're right, Brother, we can.[A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Brother![LF]
Thank you for the instruction![A][LF]
I suppose I still have a lot to learn.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, not at all![.][A][LF]
Rather, I am surprised at your rapid[LF]
progress after such a short time![.][A][LF]
I think you would give me an excellent[LF]
match were we to spar.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]You really think so? And yet, I feel[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Sigh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]If only we lived in a world where[.][LF]
such skills were not even necessary.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You're a peaceful soul.[.][A][LF]
All of this fighting[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
It must be hard on you.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]It is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I just pray that this fighting[LF]
will end as swiftly as possible.[A][LF]
No one desires this war.[A][LF]
So why must it continue?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Indeed.[.][A][LF]
And yet there is fighting in[LF]
every generation.[.][A][LF]
In ancient times, our ancestors[.][LF]
fought all manner of evil beast.[A][LF]
But once the beasts were subdued,[.][LF]
man then fought against fellow man[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
So we learned from Lyon.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I know[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
But if men understand the futility[LF]
of fighting, why do they do it?[.][A][LF]
We could gain so much more by[.][LF]
cooperation than by conquest.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]You may be right[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]But I think[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
I understand why.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why, Brother[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]I pray for peace to return to our[.][LF]
fair Renais.[A][LF]
I know that war brings only sorrow.[.][A][LF]
And yet, somewhere in my heart[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
There is a lust for battle that[.][LF]
cannot be stilled.[A][LF]
It screams within me when[.][LF]
I clutch this spear[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Brother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Perhaps it is because I am a man.[.][A][LF]
Perhaps it is because I was raised[LF]
to fight.[.][A][CR][LF]
I enjoy the practice of my art. I find[LF]
pleasure in the battle victorious.[A][LF]
And the stronger I become[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
The more strongly the call to arms[LF]
sounds within my ears.[A][LF]
I want to see how great is the skill[LF]
that I have acquired.[.][A][LF]
It may be crass and low, but I cannot[.][LF]
deny it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Brother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]You would disdain me for this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, I could never[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
But, Brother, listen.[.][LF]
No matter why you fight[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Please ensure that this fighting brings[.][LF]
good to our people and to our kingdom.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course.[LF]
I am not so far gone as that.[.][A][LF]
And I could not bear to see[.][LF]
you cry for our people.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Besides, I would fear the judgment[LF]
of your mighty sword![.][A][ToggleSmile]

[OpenMidRight]Please forgive my rudeness[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Princess, I am merely your subject.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]But still, you suffered for me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Lady Eirika.[A][LF]
You are a noble of Renais.[A][LF]
The nobility should not favor[.][LF]

How can they maintain their fealty[LF]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]

[OpenMidLeft]Oh, you needn't be sad. I would[.][LF]

Don't scare me like that![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, I'm sorry. That must have[.][LF]

all the scars from all your fights.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]

To be fair, Ephraim probably saved[LF]
my hide more often than I his.[A]

battle without thought for consequence.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Master Saleh.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Princess.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]What you were telling me about[LF]
Valega was most enlightening.[.][A][LF]
It sounds as though you align your[LF]
desires with the world around you.[A][LF]
By knowing the vastness of creation[.][LF]
around you, you come to know yourself.[A][LF]
And then, by transcending your selfish[LF]
needs, you wish for a better world.[.][A][LF]
What you told me, it helped me rediscover[.][LF]
the importance of that unselfish wish.[A][LF]
It's the reason for the war we fight[LF]
now[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]The dream of a better world.[A][LF]
Because of your Valega, my own[LF]
conviction was renewed.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ahhh. I'm glad to hear that.[LF]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Princess Eirika, you remind me of[.][LF]
the warrior princess, Nada Kuya.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Nada Kuya?[A]
[OpenMidRight]She's one of Caer Pelyn's[.][LF]
ancient heroes.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'd like to hear about her.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]I've been told she was a strong[.][LF]
woman, beautiful and proud.[.][A][LF]
She spoke with the voice of nature,[.][LF]
and she lived at one with the earth.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But you called her a battle princess[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, in ancient times, Caer Pelyn[LF]
was invaded by a foreign nation.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]And leading the charge against the[LF]
invaders was Nada Kuya.[.][A][LF]
She carried a narrow sword made from a[LF]
fang gifted to her by the dragonkin.[A][LF]
With her dragon blade in her hand,[LF]
she drove Caer Pelyn's enemies away.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wow[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Quite a story.[.....][LF]
And you think I[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes. You remind me of her.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, no[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
When Grado invaded Renais, I was[LF]
paralyzed. I couldn't do anything.[A][LF]
It is only because of the sacrifices[LF]
of others that I could even escape.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]But now, you are here. With[.][LF]
your strength, courage, and dignity.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Saleh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]If you achieve victory, the[.][LF]
legend will become reality.[.][A][LF]
You will become the Nada Kuya[.][LF]
of this age.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile] Yes, I see![A][LF]
I have a reason to fight.[.][LF]
I have things to protect.[.][A][LF]
I fight for the future. The future[LF]
of Renais, the future of my people.[.][A][LF]

courage to fight on.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]

I could not afford to feel any real[.][LF]

[OpenMidRight]Prince Ephraim, when I was injured the[LF]
other day, I came to a realization.[.][A][LF]

agree to the other day was wrong.[.][A][LF]

I'm the one who should feel honored.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I beg your pardon?[.....][LF]
What do you mean, sir?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]When I was just a squire, there was one[.][LF]
knight whom I admired above all others.[.][A][LF]
His skill with sword and spear was[LF]
legendary. He was truly peerless.[.][A][LF]
We squires learned the meaning of[.][LF]
chivalry watching him serve the king.[.][A][CR][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Ten years back, we received word that an[LF]
infamous assassin was hiding in Renais.[.][A][LF]

so as not to alert the assassin.[A][LF]
He hounded the villain and killed[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Yes, Franz.[.][A][LF]
It was the greatest knight in the[.][LF]
history of Renais. Your father.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I was so young when my father died.[.][A][LF]

Forde and I were almost always alone.[.][A][LF]

babe about my father being gone so much.[A][LF]
Forde would always remind me, [LQuote]He is serving[LF]
the royal family to protect Renais.[RQuote][A][LF]
Forde was so proud of our father, but he[LF]
was also a little bit sad.[A][LF]
I remember a deep scar he had on his[LF]
shoulder, probably in battle.[.][A][LF]
My brother and I used to climb up his[.][LF]
shoulders and vie for his attention.[A][LF]
I grew up hearing what a great knight he[LF]
was, but I remember only his shoulder.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]You probably have no idea how[.][LF]
much you resemble your father.[A][LF]
Your swordplay, how you tilt the lance,[.][LF]
your loyalty to Renais[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
You've certainly inherited your[.][LF]
father's spirit.[A][LF]
It is an honor to see the skill I once[LF]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Your skill with the spear is amazing.[.][LF]
Have you trained since you were a child?[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]No, I come from a long line of dirt-poor[LF]

[OpenMidRight]Ah-ha[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
So, what happened next?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, the emperor shows up in the room[LF]
the soldiers had thrown us.[.][A][LF]
He looks around and, in this very calm[LF]
but stern voice, says to the soldiers:[A][LF]
"What are you men doing, arresting mere[.][LF]
children? They were trying to help!"[A][LF]
Then, he invites us to dine at his table,[.][LF]
and it was a luxurious feast, I tell you![.][A][LF]
Now, we were just kids. We lacked the[.][LF]

Your skills are wasted in the fields. Let's[.][LF]

such a commanding presence.[.][A][LF]

can't believe what's happened.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I was born into a family of knights, so[.][LF]
it was a given that I should be one, too.[.][A][LF]
I trained in spear and sword. I studied[.][LF]
chivalry and swore my oaths of fealty.[A][LF]
And because of my hard work, the late[.][LF]
King Fado treated me like a second son.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]It's funny. You and I are from different[LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Why would you say something like that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You and I are from different lands.[.][LF]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Frelia's resistance training, you mean.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Can I ask you, what do[LF]
you think of this war?[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]What?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I still don't understand why Grado[LF]
chose to invade Renais.[.][A][LF]
Grado and Renais were allies. Their royal[.][LF]
families were close friends.[A][LF]
Why, Prince Ephraim and Princess Eirika[.][LF]
are friends with your Prince Lyon.[A][LF]
I detect something funny here.[A][LF]
I simply cannot believe a friendship[LF]
so strong could end so abruptly.[A][LF]
How many lives have been destroyed by[.][LF]
such a seemingly random turn of events?[.][A][LF]
Perhaps the prince and princess know[LF]
more of the truth, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, I'm sorry. I don't mean to[LF]
besmirch your homeland's name.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, it's all right. I wonder what[.][LF]
drives Grado's ambitions now, too.[A][LF]
I was born in a rural village and[.][LF]
raised in Grado's countryside.[A][LF]
Ever since I was a little child,[LF]
I took pride in my home's origins.[A][LF]
Grado, of course, is named after the[LF]
legendary hero who saved all of Magvel.[.][A][LF]
I thought I lived in a country that[.][LF]
believed in justice and peace.[A][LF]
But this war[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It's something[LF]
different than all that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Amelia[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I'm sorry.[A][LF]
This war must be especially[.][LF]
painful for you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'll be fine, Franz.[LF]
But thank you, though.[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]It was wrong of Grado to invade[.][LF]
Renais. Nothing can justify it.[.][A][LF]
Grado has no right to destroy whole[.][LF]
nations, ruin people's lives.[.][A][LF]
This is all so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]so wrong![.][A][LF]
I began this war as a soldier[.][LF]

Hm. That can't be good.[.][A]

[OpenMidRight]Oh, not again. No, Moulder.[.][LF]
I don't hear anything.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is it really just me? Am I the[LF]

Is it a dull noise? A chirp? If it's[LF]
louder, I should be able to hear it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, it's nothing like that. It's[LF]

I guess it was a hallucination after all.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Regardless of the cause, I'm glad[.][LF]
that you don't hear it anymore.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm relieved, too, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I also[LF]
miss it somewhat.[.][A][LF]
The melody was haunting me, and[.][LF]
I finally remember what it was.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]And? What was the song?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]That was the music played [LF]
at King Hayden's coronation. [.][A]

[OpenMidLeft]I was the one who carried[.][LF]
the crown to the throne.[A][LF]
I was so nervous that I[.][LF]

[OpenMidRight]I remember that you were the one[LF]
to bear that regal burden.[A][LF]
I was a mere recruit, stuck in[LF]

You know, I remember now[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Your[LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Yes, and then someone shouted, in a loud[LF]

The crown slipped, and I fumbled to[.][LF]

when I was with you. That means[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It was a sign. A sign from above that[.][LF]
we must both return to the basics.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'm so glad to hear you say that![.][LF]
I was so sad after we talked last.[A][LF]

I decided to focus on my archery.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]That's the spirit, Neimi. So, have[LF]

I never mastered archery. I'm[.][LF]
sorry I can't help you train.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, no[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Thank you, but I've[.][LF]
been thinking about this a lot.[.][A][LF]
First, I need to sharpen my vision[LF]
so I can target more easily.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Sharpen your vision?[A][LF]
Good eyesight seems essential[.][LF]
in a good archer, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
How can you improve your[LF]
vision? I don't understand.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My grandfather taught me to stare[.][LF]
into the distance and concentrate.[A][LF]
My grandfather taught me everything[.][LF]

My grandfather was[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][LF]
He was a great archer.[A][LF]
One time, a snake was attacking a bird [.][LF]
nest on a tree in a mountain far away.[A][LF]
He aimed at the snake and shot it down.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Incredible. He was able to pick out[.][LF]

a great archer.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, he was. And that's why I've[LF]
been staring into the distance.[.][A][LF]

hit each of those bugs from here.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]that would be cruel![A]

staring into the distance?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. Standing perfectly still,[LF]
staring into the distance.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Maybe it's[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]because you look[LF]
scary[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]

He thought I was angry at him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I look[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]scary? Hm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I have refined my stare to intimidate[.][LF]
my foes in battle. You may have a point.[A][LF]
No wonder people get scared when they[.][LF]
see me glowering into the distance.[.][A][LF]
You know, I might almost consider it[LF]
a compliment of my knightly prowess![A]
[OpenMidRight]I have an idea[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps if you[LF]
[ToggleSmile]smile, it might not be so scary.[A][ToggleSmile]

[OpenMidLeft]It's still scary, isn't it?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Maybe it's because you're[.][LF]
crossing your arms.[.][A][LF]
How about[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]holding some flowers[LF]

[OpenMidLeft]You want me to stare into the distance[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
smiling[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]and holding flowers?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I think that would look good[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]You're just being nice, Neimi.[A][LF]
Your keen vision is a gift, and[.][LF]
your training may improve it[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]

## MSG_C9F
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][FID_Moulder]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][FID_Vanessa]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, do you have time[LF]
for that story I promised?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Certainly, Father.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It was over ten years ago, when[.][LF]
the prince was just a child.[A][LF]
There was a ceremony at the castle,[.][LF]
with a trick archer of sorts.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]A trick archer?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. He was a very famous and undeniably[LF]
skilled archer from abroad.[.][A][LF]
He was to shoot a tiny target that had[LF]
been placed in the distance.[A][LF]
However, in the middle of the show,[.][LF]
someone stopped him from shooting.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, no[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It wasn't[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, it was young Prince Innes.[.][A][LF]
He said, [LQuote]That's not far enough![LF]
Move the target back farther![RQuote][A][LF]
Then, he insisted on trying himself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's so like him![.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Isn't it?[.][LF]
[ToggleSmile]King Hayden tried to stop him, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Well, you know how he is.[.][LF]
He doesn't listen to anyone.[A][LF]
And so, it became a contest between our[.][LF]
prince and this foreign archer.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]So, what happened?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]First, they established the ground rules.[.][A][LF]
Each person was to shoot at the target. If[LF]
both arrows hit, they increased the range.[A][LF]
They simply continued to move the target[LF]
back until one person missed the mark.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sounds simple enough.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, but the two were evenly matched.[LF]
Every shot was a perfect bull's-eye.[A][LF]
The crowd cheered, and the target[.][LF]
moved ever farther back[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
But then it came to the turning point.[LF]
The foreign archer said, [.][A][LF]
[LQuote]This is no test. Let's move the[LF]
target back more.[RQuote][A][LF]
It seemed like bravado, but the archer[LF]
actually had a clever tactic in mind.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Clever? How so?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]They had been shooting for some time,[.][LF]
and the archer's arms had grown weary.[A][LF]
Precision archery is far more taxing[LF]
than the battlefield, you see.[A][LF]
So even though he was a skilled archer,[.][LF]
he was at the limits of his endurance.[A][LF]
He was still hitting the mark accurately,[.][LF]
but his arm was quivering more and more.[A][LF]
Everyone knew that the prince was[.][LF]
on the verge of victory.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't understand. They were shooting at[.][LF]
the same target, shot for shot, right?[A][LF]
Why would moving the target make any[LF]
difference?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, they were still shooting at the[LF]
same target.[A][LF]
However, the archer suggested that they[.][LF]
move the target much farther away[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Much farther than any child Innes's age[.][LF]
could hope to loose an arrow to.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, that IS clever![.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Even the archer, with his trained arms,[.][LF]
was firing at his maximum range.[A][LF]
In fact, he almost missed the target![.][A][LF]
Then, it was the prince's turn.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]And[.][ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]It was clearly too far away for the[.][LF]
young prince to hit the target.[.][A][LF]
But His Highness was undeterred. He drew[LF]
his string and fired up into the sky.[.][A][LF]
The arrow did not merely hit the target.[LF]
No, it was a perfect bull's-eye![A][LF]
You see, the prince arced his shot[LF]
to extend his range beyond its limits.[A][LF]
To hit a target this way requires[.][LF]
incredible skill, but the prince did it.[A][LF]
And then he turned to the archer and said,[LF]
[LQuote]Shall we move the target back farther?[RQuote][A][LF]
The archer looked so crestfallen. He[LF]
admitted defeat, and it was settled.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's amazing[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]That it is.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you very much, Father[.][LF]
Moulder! That's incredible![.][A][LF]
I'm even more[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]More[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]what?[.][A]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, do what you think is best for you.[A][LF]
We all carry many burdens[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]To country,[.][LF]

That should encourage us all to[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Yes, indeed. To share the joys of life[LF]

Thank you, Syrene. In this chaos, I[.][LF]

We are all so grateful to you, Father.[A][LF]
So many different people came up to me[LF]

You are a man of great virtue, and[LF]
an inspiration to us all.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am touched[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]

pleased to meet you, Lute.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, the pegasus, the proud, winged horse.[.][A][LF]
You know, they only attach to someone they[LF]
accept as their master.[.][A][LF]
And did you know that pegasi fly by kicking[.][LF]
the air, not by flapping their wings.[.][A][LF]
It's a common misconception, but wings[LF]
are mainly used for gliding.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Yes, as captain, I learned all[LF]
this long ago. [.][A][LF]
Plus, if they flapped their wings constantly,[.][LF]
no one would be able to ride them.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]In some countries, the word pegasus [LF]
means [LQuote]fountain[RQuote] or [LQuote]ocean.[RQuote][A][LF]
Different cultures have different stories[.][LF]
about the creation of the pegasus.[A][LF]
In one legend, there was a monster who[LF]
could turn anyone into stone.[.][A][LF]
When the monster died, its blood seeped into[LF]
the ground. There, a pegasus was born. [.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Interesting[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You are very knowledgeable.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]I know.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Well! Thank you for the lesson. [LF]
I'm glad we're on the same team.[A][LF]
It was nice meeting you.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, nice to meet you, Titania.[.][A]

[OpenMidRight]Titania.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Um[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]No.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]I meant[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Vanessa, right?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm happy to know that I've made such a [LF]
strong impression on you, Lute. [A][LF]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....] So, what can I do for you?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]It's common knowledge that pegasi have[LF]
strong resistance to magic.[.][A][LF]
I developed a new counterattack to that [LF]
power, but it still needs refining.[.][A][LF]
I guess what I'm saying is[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....][LF]
Can I try it out on Titania?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?![A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidLeft]No! Of course not![A]
[OpenMidRight]I was joking.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sigh. You said it with such[.][LF]
a straight face[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
You definitely had me fooled.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you! That's so sweet of you to say.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidLeft]It wasn't a compliment![.][A][LF]
Besides, you really don't seem like someone[.][LF]
who has much of a sense of humor.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Is that right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]And it seems like your magic [.][LF]
is the real thing.[A][LF]
When you defeated the enemy the other day,[LF]
I saw a sharp flash of magic from above.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Gee, I wonder why that happened[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Because[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]you're good?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why, yes! You are 100 percent[.][LF]
correct! For once.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My point is, we don't have enough mages [LF]
in Frelia, so we're counting on you.[A][LF]
When I was growing up, I always wanted[LF]
to be a pegasus knight like my sister.[A][LF]
I was also interested in magic, but[.][LF]
I just didn't have the talent.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Well, you are a great pegasus knight, [LF]
so it's worked out fine.[A][LF]
Besides, I am also interested in [.][LF]
becoming a pegasus knight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Where are you in your training?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]I'm at 98 levels out of 158 levels total.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's very impressive[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]

You know, I'm often told that I need to[.][LF]
loosen up and not be so serious.[A][LF]
I'd always tried to be like my sister.[A][LF]
She's very strong, as both a knight and [LF]
a person. Maybe I've tried too hard.[A][LF]
But it's so much easier to loosen up [.][LF]
with people like you around. Thanks![A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]When I'm with you, I can[LF]
relax and just be myself.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidLeft]That was a compliment![LF]
Jeez. You're a tough one[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]

to come visit me in Frelia?[.][A][LF]
You could ride a pegasus if you'd like.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]That would be an illuminating experience.[.][A][LF]
But I have to start reading up on pegasi[LF]
behavior now, so I won't get thrown off.[A][LF]
Do they like carrots?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I don't know about that.[LF]

But then I started to worry about enemies[.][LF]

you were already gone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I catch them off guard that way and [LF]

[OpenMidRight]My name is Garcia. Sir Dozla, I've [.][LF]
been hearing a lot about you lately. [.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidLeft]Only good things, I hope! Ha ha ha![.][LF]
I've heard of you, too, Sir Garcia.[.][A][LF]
Mostly about your incredible strength![LF]
Hey, would you mind lifting this boulder?[.][A][LF]
Just kidding! Ha ha ha![.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Ha ha. It's not a big deal.[.][LF]
Are you normally this[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]energetic?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I stuffed myself, so [.][LF]
I'm feeling pretty great![.][A]
[OpenMidRight]You can't fight on an empty stomach.[A][LF]
Eating is very important to keep up [LF]
your strength. Especially breakfast.[A][LF]
I've heard that in some cultures, they call[.][LF]
breakfast [LQuote]first break.[RQuote][A]
[OpenMidLeft]What's that? What do they break?[A]
[OpenMidRight]A fast.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]A fast what? Huh? Speak plainly! I don't[LF]
understand all this talking in circles.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]We don't eat anything while we sleep,[.][LF]
so it's as if we are fasting.[.][A][LF]
So, the meal you eat in the morning[.][LF]
breaks that fast.[.][A][LF]
This means that breakfast is an [LF]
especially important meal.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh. Who would have thunk it?[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]The only thing I consumed this[LF]
morning was knowledge![A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Just that I make it a point[.][LF]
to learn other disciplines.[.][A][LF]
You have to if you want to[LF]
grow as a fighter.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I completely agree.[.][A][LF]
Young men in this army are strong in [.][LF]
their specific fields, but weak in others.[A][LF]
The art of complete training has been[.][LF]
lost on the younger generation, I'm afraid.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, that's right! Back in our day,[.][LF]
fighters had to learn many disciplines[A][LF]
in case they had to fill in for a [LF]
wounded teammate.[.][A][LF]
I've always wanted to learn archery.[A][LF]
The delicate precision is the opposite of[.][LF]
fighting with an axe.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Me, too. Why don't we meet sometime[.][LF]
and study it together?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's a great idea![A][X]

[OpenMidLeft]Hello there, Dozla![.][A]
[OpenMidRight]I had a great time last time![.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, indeed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I just love sparring! It's like having[LF]

[OpenMidLeft]You DO know that you're not supposed to[.][LF]

[OpenMidRight]I was only clowning around![.][A][LF]
I'm recalling that a certain someone[LF]
loaded the arrow in the wrong direction[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]No, you're the great one. [LF]
You're a menace to the enemy![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Where did you learn to fight like that?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I used to lead troops in Renais.[LF]
I learned the basics there[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Once I retired, I was living on a mountain.[.][A][LF]
My daily chores involved swinging an axe,[.][LF]
although just for splitting firewood.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]See? You learned how to apply your skills[.][LF]
to different fields.[A][LF]
Maybe archery just isn't our thing. We[LF]
should try something else.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you suggest?[A]
[OpenMidRight]How about magic?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmmm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]It can't be that difficult to learn.[A][LF]

I'm Ross, the son of the warrior Garcia.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm Amelia. Nice to meet you, Ross.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Likewise. By the way, it looks like you're[LF]
getting better at battle.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. It's mostly because you and others [LF]

I'm also getting the hang of my spear.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see. I was once a rookie too.[.][LF]
Everyone has to start somewhere.[A][LF]
We're young, and we start at the[LF]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I bought it.[LF]

It doesn't matter that we're not blood[LF]

[OpenMidRight]Hey, Ewan. Nice to meet you.[A][LF]
I've been looking for someone around my age.[LF]
Let's hang out sometime, OK?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sure, but do we have to wait until[LF]
[LQuote]sometime[RQuote]? How about now?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What are you saying?[LF]
We're in the middle of a battle![A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]The others are fighting well, so the[LF]
two of us won't make much difference.[.][A][LF]
Besides, even though I just started using [LF]
magic the other day, I'm pretty good.[.][A][LF]
If something does happen, we'll be OK.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I'm pretty confident in my [.][LF]

But, you know--how to put this delicately--[.][LF]
it's the matter of morale. [.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You certainly are dedicated.[.....][LF]
[ToggleSmile]That's a surprise.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey![A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Why don't you prove your dedication[.][LF]
by answering this brainteaser?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Like a riddle? Sounds fun![A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. It'll be really fun to watch you[.][LF]
struggling to come up with an answer. Ha![.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey! What's that supposed to mean?[LF]
Well, whatever. Let's do it.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]OK, here it is.[.][LF]
Ross, do you know what a balance is?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course I do! Who doesn't?[A][LF]
It's a type of scale with small plates[LF]
on both sides to put weights.[.][A][LF]
When both sides are the same weight,[LF]
it balances.[A][LF]
So that was the riddle? Easy![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha! You're too funny! No, that was [.][LF]
just the setup for the brainteaser.[.][A][LF]
Here's the real question.[.][LF]
Assume there are 25 pebbles.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Pebbles?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, they're really small. As small as peas.[LF]
They are all the same color and shape.[A][LF]
In this group, there's one pebble that's[LF]
lighter than all the other pebbles.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]And I must tell you the way to [.][LF]
find that pebble?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course not. [.][LF]
What kind of challenge is that?[.][A][LF]
The question is, how many times do you need[.][LF]
to use the balance to find that one rock?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]How many times? Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
It's not[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]24, is it?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]What?![......][LF]

[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh! Ha ha ha ha ha![.][LF]
That's the first time I've heard that one![A][LF]
I see. So you were thinking that you'd [.][LF]
measure the pebbles one by one![.][A][LF]
That's great, Ross! You're too funny![.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's not a compliment, is it.[.][LF]
You think I'm an idiot![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]That's not true.[.....][LF]
Actually, it is. Ha ha ha![A][LF]
And did I mention how[.][LF]
perceptive you are, too?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, you! Just you wait! I'll figure it out![.][LF]
I just need some time to think about it.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]The anticipation is killing me.[.][A][X]

[OpenMidRight]Hey, you![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, hi, Ross.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I have an answer for your brainteaser![A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]You got it, huh? That's amazing![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Y-yeah.[.][LF]
The answer is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, yes?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Four times![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]You must have worked really hard to figure[LF]
that out![.][A]
[OpenMidRight]See! See! I told you I'd get it![LF]
Fighting's not the only thing I'm good at.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]However, that's not the correct answer.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What do you mean?[.][LF]
I can't believe it! Ugh![A][LF]
If that's not the right answer, then [.][LF]
what is?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]You were close. [LF]
The right answer is three times.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Only three times?[.][LF]
How? Tell me![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]The key is how many pebbles you put on the[LF]
scales at first.[A][LF]
First, put eight rocks each on either side [.][LF]
of the scale.[.][A][LF]
The side with the lighter rock will be[LF]
higher than the other, right?[.][A][LF]
Or, if the sides are balanced, it means that[LF]
the lighter rock is in the rest of the pile.[A][LF]
So that was one turn on the balance. [.][LF]
The rest is pretty easy to figure out.[A][LF]
Let's assume that the lighter rock was[LF]
in the remaining pile of nine rocks[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Then you'd put three rocks on each side of[LF]
the scale. So that's the second turn.[.][A][LF]
If either side of the scale tips, then[LF]
the rock is in one of those two piles.[A][LF]
If the scale is balanced, then the rock[.][LF]
is one of the remaining three rocks.[A][LF]
So, now you've figured out which group[LF]
of three pebbles has the lighter one.[.][A][LF]
What you do now is put one rock from this[.][LF]
pile on each side of the scale.[.][A][LF]
Like before, if the scale tips to one side, [LF]
the lighter pebble is on the scale.[.][A][LF]
If the scale is balanced, then the[LF]
remaining pebble is the lighter one.[A][LF]
And that was the last turn on the[.][LF]
scale. Did you get all that?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh? Well, I think I got it[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]What?! I just explained it all very clearly.[LF]
You still don't get it? That's really[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really what?![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Um, nothing. Forget it. A ha ha ha ha![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][LQuote]A ha ha ha[RQuote] what? [.][LF]
What do you mean [LQuote]forget it[RQuote]?[.][A][ToggleSmile]

[OpenMidRight]Ross, didn't you say that you wanted to go [.][LF]
on an ocean voyage to train yourself?[.][A][LF]
The sea is a great place to train because[.][LF]
it strengthens both the mind and body.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Have you ever been on a voyage?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Of course. I've escorted many commercial [.][LF]
ships before.[.][A][LF]
It's embarrassing, but I got seasick for [.][LF]
the first few days.[.][A][LF]
That was very painful.[LF]
But I got used to it in a few days.[.][A][LF]
It was a long trip. Nature was more brutal[LF]
than the enemies who pursued us.[A][LF]
But after the voyage ended, I realized that[.][LF]
I grew up a lot.[A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Mind?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]If your desire to win is stronger than your[.][LF]

Your mind is your most important weapon.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Come to think of it, I have noticed that.[.][A][LF]
At our last lesson, before we even started,[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Hey, Sir Gerik[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]What is it, Ross? You seem down today.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why is the sword stronger than the axe?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]What are you talking about?[.][LF]
Just use a stronger axe to beat a sword.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's not what I mean![.][A][LF]
I want to be strong enough to split[.][LF]
a silver sword with an iron axe.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Your father[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]What about him?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]He could defeat many swordsmen[LF]
with just one axe.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So you've seen him in battle?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Just once.[LF]
He was leading a unit of the Renais army.[.][A][LF]
He was swinging his axe at the front line.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wow, my dad was really strong, wasn't he![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]He was more than just strong. [LF]
He was like a war god.[A][LF]
I have to be honest with you, Ross.[.][LF]
I was on his enemy side at the time.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?![A]
[OpenMidRight]I was a mercenary hired by the other side.[A][LF]
It was a fierce battle against Garcia's[.][LF]
unit, and we ultimately had to retreat.[.][A][LF]
Come to think of it, this is a perfect [.][LF]
example of the power of the mind.[.][A][LF]
You see, I was so intimidated by Garcia that[LF]
I had lost even before I started.[.][A][LF]
That was an unforgettable failure for me.[.][A][LF]
After that, I swore to myself that I would [.][LF]
be as strong as him with a sword.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Wow, I can't believe Dad beat you down [.][LF]
like that! He's the greatest.[.][A][LF]
But you're pretty great, too.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Someone who lost to your father?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah![.][A][LF]
You might have lost that time, but you [.][LF]
became a great swordsman because of it![.][A][LF]
OK. I'm going to stop moping around.[A][LF]
From this moment on, I swear that someday [LF]
I will destroy swords with my axe.[A][LF]
You are my witness, Sir Gerik![A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Truly, you are the son[LF]
of the warrior Garcia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's not all! I'm also the best student of[LF]
the master swordsman Gerik![.][A]
[OpenMidRight]When did you become my student?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]When I met you![.][......][LF]
Oh![.][....] Enemy detected![A][LF]
I'll catch you later![.][LF]
Give me another lesson someday, Sir Gerik.[A][LF]
I'll be much stronger by then, and maybe[LF]
I'll win a match with you![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][......]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I believe he will surpass Garcia someday.[.][A][ToggleSmile][X]

He just wanted to scare you. [.][LF]
He missed on purpose.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]No, he was aiming for me. I was [LF]
just too fast for him to hit me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]He never missed a target [.][LF]
when we went hunting.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, then, I guess I'm just [.][LF]

I just heard from one of Gerik's mercenaries[LF]

Apparently, she's very talented and was [LF]
hired for an unbelievable sum.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]A woman sword fighter??[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Rumor is that if you speak to her[.][LF]
without thinking,[.][A][LF]
she's likely to attack you out of nowhere![A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Is that so.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Maybe her face is scarred from[LF]
fighting. Yeah, that's probably it![.][A][LF]
She's beautiful, but has a very sad[.][LF]
past behind that scar.[A][LF]
And that's why she's so scary![A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]A scarred face?[.][LF]
A sad past?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Or maybe it's because her lover was[.][LF]
killed, and she's trying to avenge him.[.][A][LF]
That seems equally plausible, doesn't it?[.][A][LF]
Anyway, if you see her around, would you [.][LF]

So, how's that for stealth? That's some[.][LF]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see. The embroidery IS missing.[.][LF]
Good work.[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]It's a little early for a victory[.][LF]
celebration, though.[A][LF]
The embroidery was of a pony, correct?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh? Yeah[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Unfortunately for you, that was a fake.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The princess looked like she was [.][LF]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yup.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]That's not good.[A][LF]
It's very important for her to get enough[.][LF]

This war has been very hard for[.][LF]

I'm sure she's probably spent a few [LF]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey! I just remembered that I have this[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm so glad to hear that, Kyle. Let me [.][LF]

Long-distance relationships can be hard.[A][LF]
I can't believe it! [LF]
Stuffy old Kyle is in love![.][A][ToggleSmile]

Meriella is not my girlfriend.[LF]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Workplace romance, is it?[.][LF]
Say no more. I understand.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Just shut up and listen to me.[A][LF]
Meriella is the alias we use for Renais[.][LF]
knights on undercover missions.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Alias? Like a secret code?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Precisely.[A][LF]
We send mail addressed to Meriella, which [LF]
only the Renais knights know.[.][A][LF]
The contents are always the same:[.][A][LF]
We let them know that Prince Ephraim and [.][LF]
Princess Eirika are safe.[.][A][LF]
It's all written in secret code.[LF]
That's the letter I was sending.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Even though we're in the middle of a war,[.][LF]
does it really have to be so complicated?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes. Better to be safe than sorry.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see.[A][LF]
Well, would you like me to deliver that[.][LF]
letter?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]No. Every single soldier is[.][LF]
important in this war.[A][LF]
We need you here.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?[.][LF]
You value my service? Neat![.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Yes.[.][A][LF]
Although you do bring me some pointless [LF]
tidbits, you have also been a big help.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Great! This is so encouraging![A][LF]
Until recently, I thought I'd never have[LF]
any real connection with the knights.[.][A][LF]
But it's different now.[.][A][LF]
Now, I consider everyone involved in this [LF]
war, especially the knights like you,[.][A][LF]
to be my friends.[.][LF]
I will always fight for my friends![.][A]

delight when I saw it was your mirror![A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Sniff[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] I'm so[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
so happy![.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
You know, when I was looking for[LF]
your mirror, I was reminded[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I had a similar experience when I was[.][LF]
young. It's why I chose to be a monk.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[OpenEyes]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What happened?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]One day, when I was just a little boy,[LF]
I had lost a toy, and I was crying.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]I lived near a monastery, and one of[LF]
the monks saw me sitting there weeping.[.][A][LF]
He spent his day trying to find out why[.][LF]
I was so sad and to cheer me up.[A][LF]
It was so trivial--that toy was nothing[.][LF]
but a trinket, but to me, it had value.[.][A][LF]
I later found out a friend of mine[LF]
had taken it without asking, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Anyway, I was very happy that someone[.][LF]
had stopped to show so much concern.[A][LF]
To everyone else, I was just a petty[LF]
child weeping over a toy.[.][A][LF]
To this monk, however, I was a sad and[LF]
lost soul, crying out in need.[A][LF]
He was so kind, and he spent so much[LF]
of his day on a child's tears.[A][LF]
I admired his attitude, even then.[A][LF]
It was then that I realized that I could[LF]
honor his deed by becoming a monk.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]that's why[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, that's why.[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Oh! Your mirror![A][ToggleSmile][CloseSpeechSlow]

[OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]
[OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
I'm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]really happy[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenRight]Ah. Just as I thought.[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenRight]Your smile is delightful. It's a[LF]
vast improvement on those tears.[A][LF]
The heavens themselves must have[LF]
wanted to see that smile[A][LF]
and conspired to help me find[.][LF]
your mirror.[A]
[OpenLeft]Thank you, Artur[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
I'm so grateful.[A]
[OpenRight]No, Neimi.[A][LF]
I'm grateful to you. Talking to you[.][LF]
makes me feel at peace.[.][A][LF]
I feel like[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]some of the others make[.][LF]
light of me from time to time.[A]
[OpenLeft]Oh, that's only[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] It's just because[LF]
you're so honest and pure of heart.[.][A][LF]
Someone I know[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]teases me a lot,[LF]
too. All the time, he teases me.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry to hear that.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenLeft]Well, it's not that he's all bad.[.][LF]
He can be very kind, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
But you're kind, too, Artur.[A]
[OpenRight]Thank you.[A][LF]
You know, when you meet someone, that[.][LF]
person reflects back at you[.][A][LF]
like a mirror, revealing within them[LF]
the emotions that you project.[A][LF]
Angry people bring out the anger within[.][LF]
others, just as sullen, hopeless people[.][A][LF]
bring out nothing but the sorrow within[.][LF]
all those to whom they speak.[.][A][LF]
Do you know why so many people seem[.][LF]
kind to you, Neimi?[.][A][LF]
It is because you yourself are a kind[.][LF]
person. You bring that out in others.[.][A]
[OpenLeft]Oh, Artur[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] That's so kind--[.][LF]
I mean[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Er[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Thank you.[.][A]

kindness close to your heart.[.][A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][FID_Artur]
[OpenMidRight]What are you doing, Lute?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh![.][A][LF]
I was just observing this[.][LF]
chemida beetle.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]You haven't changed at[LF]
all, have you, Lute?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you mean?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]You spent most of your time sequestered[.][LF]
in your room, studying your books.[A][LF]
On the rare occasion you went outside,[LF]
you were paralyzed with fascination.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course! There are so many fascinating[LF]
things to be learned from nature![.][A][LF]
There are a great many books out there,[.][LF]
and I have read most of them, of course.[A][LF]
But I've found that what is written can[.][LF]
differ greatly from how things truly are.[.][A][LF]
Take this chemida beetle, for example.[A][LF]
I've been reading from [LQuote]The Glossary[LF]
of Falibrian Entomology[RQuote] lately.[A][LF]
According to the glossary, their wings[LF]
fall off once they reach maturity.[A][LF]
However, I have just found an adult[.][LF]
beetle whose wings still work perfectly![A][LF]
Exceptions do exist to the rules my[.][LF]
books outline. This is a rare specimen.[.][A][LF]
I wonder, should we take it back with us?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Sigh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]I hope this isn't another[.][LF]
of your pranks.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]My[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]pranks?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Do you remember when I loaned[.][LF]
you my copy of [LQuote]Lux Aeterna[RQuote]?[.][A][LF]
You replaced my bookmark with[.][LF]
the tail of a sedgel lizard.[A][LF]
You scared ten years off my[.][LF]
life, I swear it![.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did I do that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]And! Knowing full well that I[.][LF]
have a[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]mild[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]fear of spiders,[A][LF]
you caught a small army of them[.][LF]
and unleashed them in my room![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I thought that if I immersed[LF]
you in the thing you feared,[A][LF]
maybe you might be able to[LF]
overcome your fear entirely![A][LF]
And I went to a lot of trouble[LF]
trying to catch those spiders![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Why would you do that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I did get a bit of a kick[.][LF]
out of the experience myself.[.][A][LF]
Why? Did it bother you?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]YES![.....] [.][ToggleSmile]Oh, don't worry about it.[.][A][LF]
At least you did it because[.][LF]
you cared about me, right?[A][LF]
I'll just accept it as the best gesture[.][LF]
of kindness you can manage, Lute.[.][A][ToggleSmile][X]

monsters from the legends and epics?[A][LF]
I know how much is at stake, but[LF]
sometimes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I get so tired.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]When you're tired, there's nothing better[.][LF]
than a good meal and a long sleep.[A][LF]
And if you look at page 990 of [LQuote]De[LF]
Floris Mysticis,[RQuote] there's a special[.][A][LF]
herb that, once decocted into a potion,[.][LF]
will help relax your muscles.[.][A][LF]
Look for the parfina flower, and reduce[.][LF]
it into a thick syrup before drinking.[A][LF]
Oh, and I hear music helps you sleep.[.][LF]
If you like, I can hum something for you.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A][LF]
However, I think I'll pass on your offer,[.][LF]
delightful though your humming must be.[.][A][LF]
You must be tired as well. Take care[LF]

hum to myself instead.[A][LF]

refreshed, in fact.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Refreshed?[.....] How so?[LF]
Was it some new kind of magic?[A]

Your every word has nurtured my soul[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]

[OpenMidRight]The star-stone amulet that you[LF]

I mean it[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Sir Cormag, Genarog[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Wyvern stones are like dragonstones,[LF]
only far more rare. Mages covet them.[.][A][LF]
Having one focuses your powers,[.][LF]
refines your magical control.[.][A][LF]
But nobody knows where they come[LF]
from or how to craft them.[A][LF]
There are no more than a handful of[.][LF]
wyvern stones in the world today.[.][A][LF]

I'm sorry, were you[.][LF]
talking to me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]There's nobody else[.][LF]
here, is there?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]And who are you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I beg your pardon.[A][LF]
I should have introduced myself.[LF]
Kyle, of the Knights of Renais.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, I see. And I am Lute, mage[LF]
of profound genius.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Very well, Lute.[LF]
The pleasure is mine.[.][A][LF]
To tell you the truth, I've[.][LF]
been looking for you.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Has someone issued a search notice?[.][LF]
Or is there a bounty on my head?[A][LF]
Or is this perhaps a private matter?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]guess it would be that last one.[LF]
I have a favor to ask.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What would it be?[.][A][LF]
My requests are classified into[.][LF]
seven categories and 25 items.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't know how it would be classified,[LF]
but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I want you to help us fight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm a strong believer that morale is[LF]
best served by good leadership.[.][A][LF]
A unit of knights, all trained[LF]
by Renais's finest generals.[A][LF]
But we're fighting no ordinary foe,[.][LF]
and we need more diverse skills.[A][LF]
That's where you come in.[.][A][LF]
Because you can use magic, you[LF]
could be invaluable in helping me[.][A][LF]
develop unique battle strategies.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]So that's what you wanted[.][LF]
me for, is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]How about it? Would you do it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sure. Anything you say.[.][LF]
I don't mind.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]I should warn you, I spend my[.][LF]
time on the front line.[.][A][LF]
I ride out to meet the enemy head-[LF]
on rather than attacking from afar.[.][A][LF]
It's a much riskier prospect than[.][LF]
supporting from the rear guard.[.][A][LF]
Is that going to be a problem?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have no objections.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Excellent! I appreciate your help.[A][LF]
I expect we'll be able to generate[LF]
some stunning tactics together.[.][A][LF]
You don't need to stay at the front[.][LF]
the whole time.[.][A][LF]
I'll give you a cue when to approach.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Got it.[.][A][LF]
I'll do whatever you say.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm counting on you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You have nothing to worry about.[LF]
There's no one better than me![A][X]

a great help to us all.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, of course I have! I told you[LF]
there's no one better than me![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Magic is an incredibly[LF]

Sturdy armor, tough hide, it[LF]

[OpenMidRight]You're not so bad yourself.[.][LF]
You're an incredible fighter.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thanks.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Have you trained a lot?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yep.[A][LF]
When I was young, there was a lad[.][LF]

Every day, I trained harder and[.][LF]
harder in hopes of defeating him.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]So what happened? Did you[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Not as such, no. But I haven't[LF]
lost to him in a while, either.[.][A][LF]
We're evenly matched. I think[.][LF]
we force one another to improve.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.[A][LF]
It's always good to have someone[LF]

Aren't you glad you have this[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh-huh.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Well, uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Not to sound rude, but I didn't take you[LF]
as the kind to be interested in others.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]No, it's not rude at all. I just[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Does monk-watching count?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Monk-watching?[LF]
What are you talking about?[.][A][LF]

Do you have any favorite foods?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Out of everything I've had, curry[.][LF]
of dried toad is my favorite.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Er[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]right[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....][LF]

[OpenMidRight]I think I can guess. It's about the[.][LF]
Sacred Stones and Prince Lyon, is it?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is.[A][LF]
My mentor died[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]trying to warn us about[.][LF]
the threat our Sacred Stone posed.[A][LF]
I want to know the truth.[.][A][LF]
What is Emperor Vigarde up to? What[.][LF]

[OpenMidRight]There are as many truths out there[LF]

[ToggleSmile]Perhaps it's best simply to choose the[LF]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]In the eyes of your mentor, I would[.][LF]

the Sacred Stone were sacrilege.[A][LF]
I suspect he quite loathed the[LF]

[OpenMidLeft]You're wrong[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow]

[OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Well, I suppose[LF]
you are right about that.[.][A][LF]
Your magic stems from faith in the[LF]
unknowable, the divine presence.[A][LF]
In contrast, dark magic stems from[LF]
knowledge, from understanding.[A][LF]
We distrust what we do not understand,[LF]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Our researches ended in[.][LF]
miserable failure.[A][LF]
Grado's Sacred Stone was shattered.[.][LF]
Prince Lyon, corrupted[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
And this whole tragedy that unfolds[.][LF]
around us even now.[.][A][LF]
It's true. We mages have triggered[LF]
this age's greatest calamity.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]But why? What was it all for?[.][A][LF]
What did you hope to accomplish[.][LF]
with the power of the Sacred Stone?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]All Prince Lyon wanted was to help[LF]
people[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]and we are his servants.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Help people?[A]
[OpenMidRight]We read of a spell entitled the time shear.[.][LF]
It causes, in effect, a hole in time.[.][A][LF]
This spell warps time, punches a[LF]
hole through cause and effect.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]We lack the knowledge to reproduce[LF]
this ancient spell today.[.][A][LF]
Prince Lyon, however, was convinced[.][LF]
that we could unravel its secret.[.][A][LF]
He felt we could use it to predict--[LF]
and even prevent--future events.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Prevent[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]the future?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, we dedicated years to studying[LF]
this spell.[.][A][LF]
You see, the greater the disaster, the[LF]
farther it sends ripples through time.[A][LF]
We learned to read these ripples from[.][LF]
the future, hoping to save lives.[.][A][LF]
If we could know when a disaster would[LF]
strike, we could evacuate people.[.][A][LF]
We could save millions of lives.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][A][LF]
It seems so, so blasphemous.[A][LF]
That worldly creatures should[.][LF]
take control of fate, it--[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]Are you saying that, knowing the[LF]
future, we should do nothing?[.][A][LF]
We should simply allow people to[LF]
die in order to preserve [LQuote]fate[RQuote]?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry. I don't mean to[LF]
sound hostile.[A][LF]
Prince Lyon himself was troubled[LF]
by these same doubts, you see.[A][LF]
But we pressed on with our studies.[.][A][LF]
We felt it was our duty, in the[.][LF]
interest of all Grado's people.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Perhaps we were bitter that we[LF]
receive no credit for aiding Grado.[.][A][LF]
That we receive no accolades for our[LF]
research, for the benefit it brings.[A][LF]
I do not know. But we pressed on,[.][LF]
nonetheless.[A][LF]
The misconceptions linking the ancient[LF]
magics to [LQuote]evil[RQuote] die hard and slow.[.][A][LF]
Prince Lyon sought to change that.[A][LF]
He wanted, as we all wanted, to[.][LF]
prove that our magic had good uses.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Prince Lyon would never--[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]With our aid, Prince Lyon predicted[.][LF]
a great storm rising in the south.[A][LF]
He barred ships from leaving port,[LF]
and, oh, how the people complained.[.][A][LF]
But the storm came, and the seas[LF]
raged. We saved countless lives.[A][LF]
And Prince Lyon cared not at all[LF]
if the people loved him for it.[.][A][LF]
He only wanted them to be safe.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]And now, I see it all so clearly.[.][LF]
All our research amounts to nothing.[A][LF]
All I can do now is lament our[LF]
hunger for knowledge. Our greed.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft]I'm not sure you did.[.][A][LF]
You said that you could see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]ripples[.][LF]
of future disasters, is that it?[A][LF]
And the greater the disaster, the[.][LF]
more clearly you could read it?[.][A][LF]
Does that mean you saw something?[.][LF]
Some tremendous disaster to come?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]And in knowing about the disaster,[LF]

Could he have[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Was he studying the Sacred Stone to[.][LF]
find a way to prevent this disaster?[A]
[OpenMidRight]And what will you do, now[.][LF]
that you know this, too?[A][LF]
Haven't you called such[.][LF]
knowledge blasphemous?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]don't know what to do.[A][LF]
If my mentor were here, I think[.][LF]
he might be able to guide me.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidRight]In the southern half of the continent,[LF]
there will be a terrible quake.[.][A][LF]
The ground will shake violently.[LF]
The earth will crack open wide.[.][A][LF]
Cities will fall. Fields will[.][LF]
burn in the earth's hot blood.[A][LF]
Few will survive.[.][LF]
This is what we have foreseen.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]How-- How can this--[A]
[OpenMidRight]I advise you to leave Grado.[A][LF]
You might be able to escape the disaster[LF]
if you head north to Renais or Frelia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
I can't do that.[A][LF]
When this disaster strikes, people[LF]
will need help and healing.[.][A][LF]
If I could help them even a little[LF]
by staying behind[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]You would willingly risk certain[LF]
death to save a handful of people?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If I died serving Grado, I would[LF]
have no regrets, Master Knoll.[A][LF]

make the most of this knowledge.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....][LF]
Spoken like a true cleric.[A][LF]
You would drop everything without[.][LF]
hesitation just to help others.[.][A][LF]
This is the difference between mages[LF]

[ToggleSmile]Perhaps you might allow me to join[LF]
you when the time comes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Master Knoll?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]If I am to honor Prince Lyon's[LF]
intentions, I cannot flee this.[.][A][LF]
I am not sure how best I can help,[LF]
but I do not want anyone to die.[A][LF]
Not if, by my action, I can save them.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I agree.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]How about you? Where are[LF]

[OpenMidLeft]I haven't seen them since I[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I am.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I thought so! You know what?[LF]
That's where I'm from, too![.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Where were you born? I'm[LF]

[OpenMidLeft]I was born in a village[.][LF]
near the Renais border.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, well, you've got nothing[LF]
to worry about then.[A][LF]
When I joined the army, I was[.][LF]
stationed near the border.[A][LF]
Worst thing you've got to worry[.][LF]
about there is bandits.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[.][.....][LF]
That's so good to hear.[.][A][LF]

that. I get so worried.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, there. That's a nice[LF]

[OpenMidRight]What's the matter? You've got[.][LF]
your gloomy face on again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Doesn't this all get hard for you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]This what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Ever since this started, we've been[.][LF]
fighting nothing but Grado soldiers.[A][LF]
These are our countrymen.[.][LF]
Our families[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Every battle we win, I see only how[.][LF]
many casualties we've caused.[.][A][LF]
I'm a healer, but to win this, I[LF]
must turn my back on my countrymen.[.][A][LF]
I have to let them suffer, when[.][LF]
all I want to do is help them.[A][LF]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]But what?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Grado is responsible for all of[.][LF]
this. Our homeland[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Grado has caused so many deaths now.[LF]
We have no choice but to fight.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah. You see it now. That's the[LF]
sad irony of the battlefield.[.][A][LF]
I ride a wyvern and use my spear to[.][LF]
bring low men who should be my allies.[A][LF]
We each joined this cause in hopes of[.][LF]
bringing Grado to its senses.[.][A][LF]
Our country has set the world on its[LF]
ear, and it's up to us to right things.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I suppose[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....][LF]
You know something, Natasha?[A][LF]
You should never be ashamed of[LF]
the fact that you're from Grado.[A][LF]
You have no debt to pay, no burden[LF]
of guilt to bear.[.][A][LF]
Grado was once a magnificent country.[.][LF]
Do what you can to restore that glory.[A][LF]
It took only a handful of men to turn[.][LF]
Grado down the wrong path,[A][LF]
but perhaps a mere handful of soldiers[LF]
can set things right again.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]I understand, Cormag. I'll do what[LF]
I know to be right, no matter what.[.][A][LF]
I feel like a heavy fog has been[LF]
lifted from my heart. Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, I just wanted to see that lovely[LF]

There's a guy who hangs out near[LF]
a pub in Jehanna. He's real smooth.[.][A][LF]

I started learning these tricks so[LF]
they couldn't be used on me anymore![A][LF]

Franz, though[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] He was too little[LF]

[OpenMidRight]So that's the story behind that[.][LF]
picture in your house[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]

I remember watching you practice[LF]
swordplay when we were little.[A][LF]
I wanted to be like you, and I was[LF]
irritated that I didn't practice more.[A][LF]
I got so upset with myself when I lost[LF]
the tournament to you.[A][LF]

I had no idea you were a princess at first.[.][A][LF]
But please, just call me Cormag. There's[LF]
no need for honorifics with me.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Cormag it is, then. I had[.][LF]
a favor to ask of you.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]What would you have me do, Princess?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm prone to attacks from archers[.][LF]
when I'm on the battlefield[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]That makes two of us.[.][A][LF]
It's a common problem for[.][LF]
airborne soldiers.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I thought perhaps we could keep watch[.][LF]
for archers and warn one another.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Hm. Yes, you've got a good idea[.][LF]
there. A [LQuote]buddy system[RQuote] of sorts.[.][A][LF]
But if you saw an ally in danger, you'd[.][LF]
warn him regardless, wouldn't you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, of course! But we're so high[LF]
up that I was worried[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
If I saw an archer, I didn't think[LF]
my voice would carry to you in time.[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Perhaps the neighing of a pegasus or[LF]
the cries of a wyvern could carry[.][A][LF]
far enough to warn the others.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Oh! I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Yes, we might not be able[LF]
to hear each other in the heat of battle.[.][A][LF]
But our steeds can be louder than[.][LF]
either of us could.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]And trust me, my wyvern's shriek can[LF]
pierce your ear from two leagues away.[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]A brilliant idea, Your Highness.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[.][LF]
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right, so if we see anything out there,[.][LF]
we'll have our mounts call out, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, and thank you, Cormag.[.][A][X]

you may have saved my life![.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, you should thank him, then.[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're no traitor, Cormag. You've[.][LF]

survived.[.][A][LF]
But there's something about combat[LF]
that just doesn't agree with my nature.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]If that's the case, why are[.][LF]
you with these mercenaries?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ahh[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]The answer is so simple,[LF]
you'll probably laugh.[A][LF]
Back when I was a kid, a friend from my[.][LF]
village said he wanted to be a mercenary.[.][A][LF]
He said he was going to be famous, the[LF]
greatest warrior in all the land.[.][A][LF]
No matter how many times I told him to[LF]
give it up, he wouldn't listen to me.[.][A][LF]
Well, one day, he left for Jehanna.[.][A][LF]
I didn't know what else to do, so I went[LF]
with him and joined the guild, too.[.][A][LF]
Stupid reason, isn't it? Anyway[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I didn't particularly like fighting, and[LF]
while I wasn't opposed to the money,[A][LF]
I certainly wasn't in it for fame[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I just couldn't let my friend go off[LF]
and get killed.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]And where is this friend now?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]He went off and got killed.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So there was no reason for me to[LF]
continue being a mercenary[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
But then there were other men who I[.][LF]
considered to be my friends.[A][LF]
I couldn't bring myself to abandon them[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
And so the years passed and here I am.[A][LF]
The thing is I can't stand to see my [.][LF]
friends die.[A][LF]
But if you're in this business long enough,[.][LF]
people around you get killed. It happens.[.][A][LF]
The only thing you can do is keep moving[LF]
forward and try not to think about it.[A][LF]
So[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Yes, I'd have a problem if you[LF]
got yourself killed.[A][LF]
I've got no place else to go, and I'm tired [LF]
of trying to forget.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmph[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
Do you really think I'd lose so easily?[.][A][LF]
It won't do for you to underestimate me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, uh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Right.[A][ToggleSmile][X]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Eh?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]There's something I've always assumed[.][LF]
to be true[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Those born to royalty cannot show[.][LF]
others any weaknesses or deficiencies.[A][LF]
If they're not perfect at all times, their[LF]
enemies will take advantage of them.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah? So?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]But meeting you has made me rethink[.][LF]
that belief.[A][LF]
My father told me before I left that[LF]
I should watch you and learn from you.[A][LF]
At the time, I believed there was[.][LF]
nothing a mercenary could teach me.[.][A][LF]
Now I know better. I am thankful to both[LF]
my father and you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's enough of that. In my opinion,[.][LF]
you're much finer than I could ever be.[.][A][LF]
The way you live, your manners, and your[LF]
bearing[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] I could never pull it off.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Me? What do you mean?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Look at you! You're full of confidence.[.][LF]
You've got pride.[.][A][LF]
When I first met you, I thought,[LF]
[LQuote]What a high-handed dandy.[RQuote] [A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you just call me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]a dandy?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But that's just who you are.[A][LF]
Being proud is not always[.][LF]
a bad thing.[A][LF]
You must have worked yourself near to[.][LF]
death to preserve that pride.[.][A][LF]
What I mean is that you never make[LF]
excuses for losing or being beaten up.[A][LF]
No matter the pain you face or hardship, [.][LF]
you keep on fighting to honor that pride.[.][A][LF]
It's what defines you, and I can't[LF]
say that I don't admire it.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]It comes naturally.[.][A][LF]
I will be king one day, and I will make[.][LF]
Frelia the greatest nation in all the world.[A][LF]
It will be a wonderful kingdom of wealth [.][LF]
and power.[A][LF]
When that day comes, I will command you[.][LF]
to become general and lead Frelia's armies.[.][A][LF]

make you general.[.][A][ToggleSmile]

[OpenMidRight]Well, hello.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Imagine meeting you here.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You know, I believe this is[.][LF]
our first chance to speak privately.[A][LF]
I am L'Arachel of the Theocracy of Rausten.[.][LF]
It's a pleasure to meet you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I believe you already know my name.[.][A][LF]
I am Innes, prince of Frelia.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Speaking of Frelia[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Oh, I remember,[.][LF]
the seafood was delicious there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes. I would agree that the fish of[.][LF]
my homeland is not unpleasant.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]However it does not compare with[LF]
that of my home, Rausten.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Is that so?[.][A][LF]
I know not what fish your country[.][LF]
has to offer, but I have a hard time[A][LF]
imagining they could be that much[.][LF]
tastier than our own.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Your doubt is not surprising.[.][A][LF]
Once this war is over, you must[.][LF]
come and visit Rausten.[.][A][LF]
I think it best if you try a wide[.][LF]
variety of our fish for yourself.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's a good idea.[.][LF]
I will most certainly do so.[A][LF]
And perhaps you have not tasted[.][LF]
all the fish Frelia has to offer.[.][A][LF]
To be sure, you should visit again.[.][LF]
Perhaps a culinary exchange is in order.[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]It may be you change your opinion.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]We'll see.[......][LF]
Very well, I accept your invitation.[A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Are you sure you're supposed[LF]
to be here?[.][A][LF]
I wonder if you're truly here with the[LF]
permission of your superiors.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Of-of course I am![A][LF]
What gives you the right to speak[.][LF]
to me in such a manner?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I have heard a bit about[LF]
your wild behavior[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]H-how rude you are![.][A][LF]
If I were not a holy woman, I[.][LF]
would beat you senseless.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]How savage YOU are.[.][A][LF]
Perhaps you could learn self-control by[.][LF]
observing Frelia's pegasus knights.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Yes, there's something I'd like to show you.[A][LF]
When the Frelia's pegasi gather[.][LF]

It's a spectacle of such beauty[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]If it is beauty you seek, then[LF]
Rausten is second to none.[A][LF]
Do you know of Rausten's lofty[LF]
peak Mount Mimir.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]I pity those who die without having[.][LF]
gazed upon its breathtaking beauty.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
If you recommend it so highly, then[.][LF]
yes, I would indeed like to see it.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes. That would be splendid[.][LF]
indeed.[.][A][LF]
But there are many more equally[.][LF]
beautiful places in Rausten.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then perhaps you should tell me[.][LF]
about them for future reference.[A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]The Theocracy of Rausten certainly[LF]

[OpenMidRight]As does Frelia, much more[.][LF]
than I imagined it would.[.][A][LF]
And yet[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]You mean to ask which is the[LF]
more spectacular? Is that it?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]What? That's no question at all![LF]
Rausten is clearly superior in every way.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I expected you would say so.[A][LF]
But what of the truth?[LF]
Your opinion is subjective, is it not?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
All opinions are subjective,[A][LF]
but I'm sure an objective evaluation[LF]
would yield the same result.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]To prove that, we will need some[LF]
fair and impartial third in our discussion.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Indeed! And I have[LF]
a splendid idea.[A][LF]
Let the pair from Renais judge.[.][A][LF]
Surely Ephraim and Eirika can come to[.][LF]
a proper decision.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Of course. I agree completely.[A][LF]
I think I should remind the two of all[LF]
the wonder Frelia holds.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then it's decided.[A][LF]
They will visit both of our homes, and[LF]
we'll show them such splendor as to[.][A][LF]
leave them breathless.[A][LF]
Invitations to tour our two nations[.][LF]
will surely have them overjoyed.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It would only be natural.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]It would be natural.[A][LF]
Very well then. Let us deal with this[.][LF]
evil and take those two home with us.[.][A][LF]
First and foremost, it is a competition[.][LF]
to see whose land is more magnificent![A]

up against you.[.][A]

our contest later, though.[A][LF]
You may be composed before others, but[LF]
you'll surely be lonely on your own.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Be warned yourself. Your words here may[.][LF]
prove embarrassing to you later.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's not a problem.[.][A][LF]

Nor for today's meal.[.][A]

Oh, I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I wandered about with little Ewan in tow.[.][LF]
He had no idea what was happening.[A][LF]
I was a child myself with no job.[.][A][LF]
We went to bed hungry every night,[LF]
and our clothes were rags[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then one day I said to myself,[LF]
[LQuote]We cannot go on like this![RQuote][A][LF]
I watched a dancer on a street corner[.][LF]
and memorized all of her moves.[.][A][LF]
I wasn't a very coordinated child and[.][LF]
it was so difficult.[A][LF]
I didn't have real shoes, so my feet[LF]
were a mess of blisters,[A][LF]
and I fell so many times I was covered[LF]
in cuts and bruises.[A][LF]
It was painful. And miserable. And[LF]
very, very difficult. But I never cried.[A][LF]
Because if were to cry, he would cry.[.][LF]
And I loved seeing Ewan's smiling face.[.][A][LF]
I wanted him to smile all the time,[.][LF]
so I worked hard so he could.[.][A][ToggleSmile]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]OK, that's enough. The past is the past![LF]
You mustn't tell anyone about this.[.][A][LF]
I don't share this story with others.[.][LF]
I only told you because you're the chief.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidRight]Um, Chief, there's actually one[.][LF]
thing I've been wanting to ask you.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]And what's that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sorry if this brings up any bad memories, but[.][LF]
how'd you get that scar on your face?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]This?[.][A][LF]
I got this beauty when I had[LF]
just started out as a mercenary.[A][CR][LF]
I was still a novice, but I was feeling[.][LF]
pretty good about my swordsmanship.[.][A][LF]
I got to a point where I was arrogant[.][LF]
enough to believe no one could best me.[.][A][LF]
Then one day it happened[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It's something[LF]
I've never been able to forget.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]What happened?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It was just another battle. I'd been hired[LF]
on as another sword and then I met him.[.][A][LF]
He was a knight from some country[.][LF]
or another.[.][A][LF]
I had fought knights on several other[.][LF]
occasions and had beaten them all.[A][LF]
Even though he was a bit tougher,[.][LF]
I was sure I'd defeat him in the end.[.][A][LF]
That's what I thought.[A][LF]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CR][LF]
His strength was beyond me. I may as well [LF]
have been using a broomstick to fight.[A][LF]
I remember thinking, [LQuote]What a tiny little[LF]
world I've been living in.[RQuote][.][A][LF]
He crushed me effortlessly, and the wound[.][LF]
he inflicted became this lovely scar.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I was truly frightened. It was the first[LF]
time I'd experienced fear as a mercenary.[.][A][LF]
So this knight saw how scared I was[.][LF]
and said, [LQuote]Go.[RQuote][.][A][LF]
He didn't kill me.[LF]
He let me escape.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I was humiliated and ashamed.[.][A][LF]
My eyes were finally opened to [.][LF]
my own weakness.[A][LF]
It goes without saying I lost every[.][LF]
shred of self-confidence.[.][A][CR][LF]
[.....]I still dream about it sometimes.[.][LF]
It wakes me up every time.[A][LF]
I've never forgotten that knight.[.][LF]
He thought I was weak and pathetic.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Chief[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I was young and stupid.[.][LF]
This scar is my punishment.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]But that knight[.][LF]
spared your life.[.][A][LF]
Because of that, good things and[LF]
better things have happened?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What do you mean, Tethys?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]First of all, Chief, you're alive.[A][LF]
If you had died, all the good times[.][LF]
you've had since that day,[A][LF]
and all the joy you're sure to have[.][LF]
from this day onward, wouldn't exist.[.][A][LF]
And another thing, because you lived, you[.][LF]
made many friends and you met me.[.][A][LF]
I also don't think that knight thought[LF]
you were pathetic.[A][LF]
I think he saw a young man with his whole[.][LF]
life ahead of him.[A][LF]
That's why he let you go.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Tethys[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Yep. [.][.....]I'm sure that's it. So try[LF]
thinking about it in a more positive light.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha. [....]You're right.[.][LF]
I was a lot calmer after that.[A][LF]
And while I've had hard times,[LF]
there've been far more good times.[A][LF]
I guess you could say I owe my success[LF]
as a mercenary to that knight.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yep.[LF]
You've got your knight,[.][A][LF]
and I've got my dancer. Thanks to the[.][LF]
two of them, the two of us are here now.[A][LF]
Say, Chief, why don't we become like them?[A][LF]
I think we should work at being[.][LF]
inspirations to other people.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]good idea.[A][CR][LF]
Thanks, Tethys.[.][LF]
I think I'll sleep soundly tonight.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Good.[.][.....][LF]
You know, Chief, I'm really happy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, me, too. I've got a life I enjoy [.][LF]

The elder's eyes[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]they were not the[.][LF]

But the thing about the elder is that[.][LF]
her eyes weren't harsh, or judgmental.[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]That's what I like about her.[.][A][LF]
Actually, when I first met her, she[.][LF]
intimidated me.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidRight]You know, coming back as someone else[.][LF]
after you die?[A][LF]
If you were going to be reborn,[.][LF]
what would you like to be?[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Perhaps a beautiful dancer like me?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm fine with being me.[.][LF]
I can't imagine anything else.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I thought that's what you'd say.[A][LF]
Actually, I thought of lots of things, but[LF]
really can't imagine any other life.[A][LF]
I guess that means that in spite of all the[.][LF]
hardships we've faced, we're really happy.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]I suppose so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Living in this age means that we face many [.][LF]
bad things and then worse things. Yet[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]We're alive, so that means we also get[LF]
good things and then better things, too.[A][LF]
In tough times, I sometimes think I'd like[LF]
to be reborn in another time, but the[.][A][LF]
important thing is to not give up and to[LF]
live your life to the fullest.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]When you die, life is over.[.][LF]
There's no such thing as being reborn.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, you may be right.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]We only get one chance.[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Why is that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's because I'm a dragon.[A][LF]
My father explained it to me.[.][A][LF]
We are both human and monster.[A][LF]
And because we are both, we[.][LF]
are also neither.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]We have the power of dragons; therefore,[LF]
we cannot live together with humans[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]

[ToggleSmile]Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gwah ha ha! The name's Dozla.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm Ewan. It's nice to meet[.][LF]
you, Dozla, sir![A]
[OpenMidRight]Aren't you a little bundle of energy?[.][LF]
I bet you're a regular troublemaker.[A][LF]
So, what were you so lost in thought[LF]
over? You having any problems?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Nope, nothing.[LF]
I don't have any problems.[A][LF]
I was thinking of something interesting.[LF]
You want to hear about it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sure. Tell me everything.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I was thinking of how much fun it[.][LF]
would be if I could do something[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh-huh.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Some battlegrounds are full of plants and[.][LF]
stuff, but others are dreary and dead.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]If a place like that were suddenly filled[.][LF]
with beautiful colors, it'd be neat, right?[.][A][LF]
Like if it could suddenly become[LF]
a flower garden?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ho ho, a battleground becoming a[LF]
lovely flower garden?[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Aye, that would be nice. It would help[LF]
heal the hearts and minds of the soldiers.[A][LF]
But how would you do it? Do you have some[.][LF]
sort of magical powers or something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, I do, but I've decided that[.][LF]
wouldn't be the best way.[.][A][LF]
If I did that, people would be more impressed[.][LF]
by the magic than by the flowers.[.][A][LF]
I think it would be better to make it[.][LF]
something that anyone could do and enjoy.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
It's all too difficult for me to follow,[LF]
[ToggleSmile]but it sure sounds like a nice dream.[.][A][LF]
If you could pull it off, I'm sure[LF]
people would really enjoy it.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ha ha[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I haven't really thought[LF]
much about how I would do it.[.][A][LF]
I was just thinking how nice it[.][LF]
would be, that's all.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha! That's fine. That's what[LF]
young people are supposed to do.[A][LF]
Many great things come from the[.][LF]
daydreams of youth.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really? Do you think so? All[LF]
right! I like you, mister.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha! Is that so?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yep. And I'm going to call you[LF]
Uncle Dozla from now on![A][LF]
It's about time for me to get going.[LF]
I'll talk to you later, Uncle Dozla![A]
[OpenMidRight]All right, laddie![LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Uncle Dozla![A]
[OpenMidRight]So, you're in high spirits today?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yep! I'm always in high spirits.[LF]
How about you, Uncle?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I'm doing as well as can be[.][LF]
expected. I'm a bit tired, actually.[A][LF]
I'm a bit closer to the ground than everyone[LF]
else, so my legs tire easily. Gwah ha![A][LF]
It would be nice if there were an easier[LF]
way to move around, wouldn't it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, that reminds me.[LF]
I've been thinking of something.[A][LF]
Do you want to hear about it?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's this? Have you come up with[LF]
yet another fabulous idea?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Yep![A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, what is it?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Coaches! You're familiar[LF]
with coaches, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh-huh.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]And we've got a coach in our convoy[.][LF]
because it can carry people and supplies.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, they're useful enough.[A][LF]
They're nice if you're traveling far with [LF]
wounded men, children, and whatnot.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]But without roads, they're almost useless,[LF]
and forget about dense forests.[.][A][LF]
Oh, and they can be quite vulnerable in[.][LF]
a battle. Not very useful at all, really.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Exactly! So I was thinking about coaches[LF]
that could travel in the air[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's that?[A][CR][LF]
Are you talking about using[.][LF]
pegasus knights?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]That's what I was thinking at first. But[LF]
you know, that probably wouldn't work.[A][LF]
I mean, a pegasus can get mighty picky[LF]
about who it lets ride him, right?[A][LF]
I haven't really thought about how to[.][LF]
actually make a flying coach, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
But wouldn't it be amazing if one[.][LF]
really existed?[.][A][LF]
It would be fast, and all that stuff like[.][LF]
bad roads and forests wouldn't matter![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ho ho ho ho![A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]And even if people lived far apart, they[LF]
could visit one another quickly![A][LF]
What do you think?[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
[OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha! It's fantastic! And it[LF]
would be useful, that's for sure![.][A][LF]
Sounds like fun, too. I'd sure love[.][LF]
to ride about in a flying coach.[A][LF]
Think about it[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]the land spread out below,[LF]
glittering dawn skies[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]and the wind![.][A][LF]
Ah, it all sounds like a dream.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I hope it becomes reality someday.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Me, too.[A][LF]
I like the way your mind works,[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Uncle Dozla.[A][LF]
Listen to this, will you? I've[LF]
been thinking about something new.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ooh, I can hardly wait.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Imagine people far away from each[.][LF]
other talking.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Far away? You mean, like, if you[LF]
and I were maybe[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]100 paces apart?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Nope. Farther than that.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]All right, 1,000 paces![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Not even close. Farther still![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]10,000 paces? You must be kidding.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]No, I'm not. And even farther than[LF]
that! For example[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
What if one person were in Frelia,[LF]
and the other person were in Rausten?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?![A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]That's right! Anyone you could[LF]
think of, you could talk to.[A][LF]
I read about magical devices that[.][LF]
could do the same thing, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Wouldn't it be better if anyone[.][LF]
could do it, and not just mages?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Impressive! I think I see it[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
People could send and receive important[.][LF]
messages instantly, is that it?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]No, even better than that![A][LF]
I'm not talking about just sending[LF]
messages back and forth.[A][LF]
I mean like if they could talk,[.][LF]
just like you and I are now![A][LF]
We wouldn't need messengers at[LF]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I just can't wrap my head around this[.][LF]
one, laddie. It's too much for me.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Great, isn't it?[A][LF]
You could contact your people in[LF]
Rausten from anywhere, at any time![.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]My, oh my[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You've got quite[LF]
an imagination, don't you?[A][LF]
The things you come up with always[LF]
surprise me, laddie.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha.[.][A][LF]
I used to get in trouble for always[.][LF]
thinking up these outlandish things.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha! That's a shame, laddie.[.][A][LF]
After all, I'm sure a lot of the things[.][LF]
we have now seemed outlandish once.[.][A][LF]
If nobody dreamed, nothing new would[LF]
ever be created, would it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uncle Dozla[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]You always have time to listen to my[LF]
ideas, Uncle. It makes me really happy.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's always worth the time to listen to[.][LF]
you youngsters and your ideas.[A][LF]
It's sad, but I know people who are so[LF]
busy that they've no time to spare.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]But me, I've got time. As you know,[.][LF]
I'm one of Princess L'Arachel's men.[A][LF]
I'm not the brightest fellow around, so[.][LF]
she doesn't give me a lot to do.[A][LF]
But that gives me lots of free time, and[LF]
I'm always happy to spend it with you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you. I think you're[.][LF]
the best, Uncle Dozla![A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
[OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha! What a nice thing to say.[.][LF]
And I think you're the best, laddie.[A][LF]
I think when you're fully grown, you're[.][LF]
going to be a great and interesting man.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you really think so?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]I do. It's that sparkle in[LF]
your eyes that convinces me.[A]

It's weird[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]but there are times when[LF]
I can almost picture a world like that.[.][A]

Ah, to what end do we toil on this[LF]
unforgiving earth? Why do we live?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why do we live? Well, if you're not[.][LF]
alive, then you're dead, and[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Er[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]if you're dead, then you[LF]
can't eat, and[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
What was I saying?[.....][LF]
I think I must be getting hungry.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]I wonder what's for dinner.[.][LF]
My belly's a-rumbling![A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]It must be nice to have no worries[LF]
other than what to eat, old man.[A][LF]
And not just you, either.[.][A][LF]
I'm sure that a certain young lady[LF]
has nothing to worry about, either.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]What's that?[LF]
Do you mean Princess L'Arachel?[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]That girl believes the world will turn[LF]
out just as she envisions it.[.][A][LF]
I doubt if the word [LQuote]worry[RQuote] even has[LF]
any meaning to her in the first place.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]What a completely envious[.][LF]
position to be in.[A][LF]
I may not look it now, but I'm the[LF]
son of a wealthy Carcino merchant.[A][LF]
I believed that you could move the[LF]
world if you but had the gold.[A][LF]
Money was everything, and with money,[.][LF]
nothing was beyond my reach![A][LF]
I adored money! I loved money! You see?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What good fortune for you that your[.][LF]
father was a thriving merchant.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]That's just it[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]There are people who can[LF]
do anything without any money at all[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
She's overbearing and egotistical, yet she[LF]
has us all jumping through hoops.[.][A][LF]
That's a skill normal people[LF]
don't possess.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's Princess L'Arachel![LF]
She makes the impossible possible![A][LF]
You're with her because she made a[LF]
deep impression on you, too, right?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]A deep impression? It's more like I'm in[LF]
shock, and my brain's been frozen.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]

[OpenMidLeft]You know, Rennac. I was just[LF]
thinking about something.[.][A][LF]
These battles are tough on an[.][LF]
old man like me.[A][LF]
I might not make it through[.][LF]
to see the end of this.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Where did that come from?[.][LF]
It better not be an omen.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I want to see Princess L'Arachel[LF]
in her wedding dress one day.[.][A][LF]
That's my one wish in life:[.][LF]
to see her happily wed.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Telling me about it isn't[.][LF]
going to make it happen.[A][LF]
Trying to find a worthy prince who's[LF]
willing to take Princess L'Arachel?[.][A][LF]
That's no easy task to accomplish.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If I end up food for the crows, if[LF]
I cannot escort the princess home,[A][LF]
I want you to take care of her for me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What? Why? No, I won't do it.[.][LF]
You can't make me! Sorry, but NO![.][A][LF]
You're the vassal, old man. I'm nothing[.][LF]
more than an escort, a thief.[.][A][LF]
When this war's over, I'm going to collect[LF]
my pay and then disappear. You got it?[A][LF]
Once Princess L'Arachel settles down,[.][LF]
she'll probably never leave Rausten again.[A][LF]
It's got nothing to do with me.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's cold, Rennac[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][LQuote]Congratulations, Princess L'Arachel![RQuote][LF]

By the way, I have a favor I've[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]What is it? Please tell me.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Your stories tell of a small lance you[LF]
carry like a treasure. May I see it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Stories, you say? Am I the subject[LF]

Here is the lance you're talking about.[.][LF]
Examine it at your leisure.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]It[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It really is[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
It's a Gavaleus[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh! You've heard of Gavaleus, have you?[.][A][LF]
You must know quite a bit about the[.][LF]
crafting of weapons.[A][LF]
This is one of Gavaleus's final works.[A][LF]
I have quite a collection of weapons, but[.][LF]
this is among the most beautiful of them.[.][A][LF]
While it can be used in battle, I would[.][LF]
never dull its shine with blood or dirt.[A][LF]
If I ever use this lance, I vow that it[.][LF]
will be only in my own final hour.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It shines as though it could light[LF]
up the soul of its wielder.[.][A][LF]
You're right. I would hesitate to[.][LF]
stain its beauty with blood, too.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, so you grasp what I mean?[.][ToggleSmile][LF]
Cormag, you have a discerning eye.[A]

Here it is. This lance.[.][LF]
What do you think of it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]My![.][.....] It has such power! It[LF]
sends chills down my spine[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I am not nearly strong enough to[LF]
wield a weapon such as this.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm, you think so? Merely holding this[.][LF]
lance makes me tremble with dread.[A][LF]
Not overly so, but enough to stop[.][LF]
me from wielding it in combat.[A][LF]
This lance[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It can drive its[LF]
wielder to madness.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Madness, you say?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, Cormag. It's a magic weapon of dark[LF]
design that's been in my family for ages.[.][A][LF]
Legend states that the leader of our house[LF]
must always carry it, but never use it.[.][A][LF]
We are prohibited from wielding it until such[.][LF]
a time as madness itself rules the day.[.][A][LF]
It's part of my legacy, and yet[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
I made a grave error[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I allowed Valter to use this lance.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]You let Valter[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]We were in the middle of a battle.[A][LF]
Valter had broken his lance, and when I[.][LF]
wasn't looking he somehow took this one.[A][LF]
From that moment, he was changed[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
He killed everyone[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]even retreating men.[A][LF]
I took the lance from him when I realized[.][LF]
what had happened, but it was too late.[.][A][LF]
Madness had awakened within Valter and[LF]
was coursing through his body.[A][LF]
From then on, he hungered only for battle[.][LF]
and for blood[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
It's not as though Valter was a gentle lamb[.][LF]
before, but now his appetite for violence[.][A][LF]
increased many times over. It's all[.][LF]
because of this cursed lance.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
That odd light playing around the point[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
I thought it looked familiar.[.][A][LF]
It was Valter[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It's the same light Valter[LF]
had in his eyes on the battlefield.[.][A][LF]
Valter's insane because of this lance.[LF]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Sir Duessel, if it please you, would you[LF]
let me have this lance?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidLeft]What? You?[LF]
B-but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Are you worried that I will[.][LF]
end up like Valter?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]N-no[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]This lance[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]someone needs to master it.[.][LF]
It's just a feeling I have.[.][A][LF]
A weapon is only as good or evil as[.][LF]
the man who wields it.[A][LF]
In the hands of someone just, it can[LF]
be a righteous weapon.[A][LF]
In the hands of the wicked, it's a[LF]
danger to all.[A][LF]
Believe me, I have not been seduced[.][LF]
by this lance.[A][LF]
I merely want to see it used for the[LF]
purpose for which it was forged.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I understand you, Cormag.[.][LF]
I'm going to let you have it.[.][A][LF]
I have no son. I had not yet decided[LF]
to whom I should pass on this legacy.[.][A][LF]
Now I see that leaving it to someone[LF]
whom I trust and believe in is best.[A][LF]
As with me, your admiration of weapons[LF]
is balanced by a healthy respect.[.][A][LF]
You also have a good eye, and you[.][LF]
possess tremendous strength.[A][LF]
The day you are able to wield this lance[LF]
may not be far off at all.[A][LF]
If the madness in this lance can be tamed,[LF]
it may very well be a weapon without equal.[.][A][LF]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I never had the courage to wield it, but[LF]
I would love to see it used righteously.[A][LF]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I am entrusting it to you.[LF]
I hope you will use it one day.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]I accept your gift, Sir Duessel.[A][CR][LF]
I would receive it once this battle is[LF]
finished and our hearts are calmer.[.][A][LF]
If I were to take it in the heat of[.][LF]
battle, I might become Valter the second.[.][A][LF]
It is a possibility that I cannot dismiss.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I see.[.][LF]
Cormag[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I'm counting on you.[A][LF]
I look forward to the day I can see[.][LF]
this lance wielded correctly.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Understood.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]General Duessel.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It seems like you've grown quite[LF]
comfortable with the spear.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir! I have, sir.[LF]
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You did well to choose the spear as[.][LF]
your weapon. It suits your height well.[.][A][LF]
It also extends your reach and[LF]
enables you to strike with force.[.][A][LF]
More force, even, than a sword[LF]
could bring to bear in a battle.[A][LF]
All weapons have their own[LF]
unique characteristics.[.][A][LF]
You're familiar with the idea that some[.][LF]
weapons are strong against others?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Isn't that what they call[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
the weapon triangle?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, it is. And from the looks of things,[.][LF]
your affinity for the spear is quite good.[A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]If you continue to practice, you should[.][LF]
continue to improve and grow stronger.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really?[.][.....][LF]
Ah, that makes me happy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Mm. To begin with, the spear[LF]
is quite a deep weapon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Yet the attacks comprise three[LF]
surprisingly simple movements.[A][LF]
Right step, left step, and thrust.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]Right step, left step, and thrust[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
I'm following you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Excellent.[LF]
But listen, Amelia.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidLeft]Y-yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Because they are so simple, they are[LF]
easy to learn but tough to perfect.[.][A][LF]
They are the strongest and most[.][LF]
pure of techniques.[.][A][LF]
When you practice them, practice[LF]
perfecting each gesture.[A][LF]
And remember, the spear is a subtle[.][LF]
and powerful weapon.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir![.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Now it goes without saying that other[.][LF]
weapons have their good points, too.[A][LF]
Swords are easy-to-use, all-purpose weapons,[LF]
and axes possess devastating strength.[A][LF]
You should learn to use each weapon type.[.][A][LF]
If you can master them all, you'll be[.][LF]
an unstoppable force.[.][A][LF]
That is, of course, if you can overcome[.][LF]
your own natural affinities.[A][LF]
To begin with, you should work on[.][LF]
mastering one weapon type.[A][LF]
Then you can gradually change weapons[.][LF]
until you can use them all.[.][A][LF]
That's what I have done, you understand.[A][LF]
That's called being multi-proficient.[.][A][CR][LF]
[ToggleSmile]I'd like to tell you more about different[.][LF]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, General Duessel.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]I've been looking for you.[LF]
And now I've found you.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Um, wh-what's happened? I've[LF]
never seen you in such a rush.[A]
[OpenMidRight]There's something I'd like to ask[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][LF]
No, something I'd like to tell you.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Er, all right.[LF]
What is it?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]I remembered.[.][A][LF]
I told you that I thought I'd seen[LF]
your face before, didn't I?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Uh, yes.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]Oh, is that it?[.][A][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Please don't keep me[LF]

Melina[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]And what happened to her?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]When I was just a child, she was[LF]
stolen away by bandits.[.][A][LF]

[OpenMidLeft]
[OpenEyes]
[OpenMidLeft]What!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It happened a few years back.[.][A][LF]
I was leading a patrol near[.][LF]
the Grado border.[.][A][LF]
We unexpectedly rode up on a group of[.][LF]
bandits, and a battle ensued.[.][A][LF]
When we had taken care of the bandits,[LF]
we rescued a lone female captive.[.][A][LF]
We figured she had been taken from some[.][LF]
village, but she was in shock.[A][LF]
In fact, her distress was so great, she[.][LF]
had forgotten much about herself.[.][A][LF]
Her body was in such a weakened[.][LF]
state that she could barely walk.[.][A][LF]
We felt such pity for her that we took[LF]
her to a peaceful village we knew of.[.][A][LF]
There, we set up a home for her where[.][LF]
she could recover and live quietly.[.][A][LF]
Some years later, she was restored[LF]
to her former vitality.[.][A][LF]
Slowly, she began to recall the lost[LF]
memories of her past.[.][A][LF]
Only recently did she remember that[.][LF]
she had once had a daughter.[A][LF]
I took time off from my duties and visited[LF]
the village where she had lived.[A][LF]
But the villagers told me her daughter[LF]
had left the village some time ago.[.][A][LF]
With no clues as to the girl's whereabouts,[.][LF]
I'd almost given up hope of finding her.[A][LF]
And then, in the strangest of places[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]
[OpenLeft]I-it can't be! Th-that woman[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
What is her name?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]Her name is Melina[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][......][LF]
[ToggleSmile]Amelia, she's your mother.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenLeft]What!?[......][LF]
Are you[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Are you sure?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I am. I see Melina's[.][LF]
face reflected in your own.[.][A][LF]
There's no mistake.[.][.....][LF]
Isn't it wonderful, Amelia?[.][A][ToggleSmile]

[OpenMidLeft]Don't tell me you've joined[.][LF]
up here as well, have you?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]General Duessel.[A][LF]
Prince Lyon no longer holds the capital.[A][LF]
My reason for remaining is gone[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Knoll, I have something[.][LF]
I would ask you.[A][LF]
What exactly happened to[LF]
His Majesty and Prince Lyon?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
Do you have the courage to[LF]
hear that answer?[.][A][LF]
I think perhaps that it will not[LF]
be an answer you want to hear.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What does that mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Are you familiar with a certain foreign[.][LF]
anecdote of comedic nature?[.][A][LF]
It involves two starving men[LF]
and a single loaf of bread.[.][A][LF]
If they break the loaf in two,[LF]
both men will die of starvation[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Knoll, I'm not asking for a riddle.[.][LF]
Let's not waste any more time here.[.][A][LF]
I'm ready to hear the truth. Nothing[LF]
you tell me could surprise me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]If that is your wish, General[.][LF]
Duessel[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I will speak frankly.[.][A][LF]
This is something that Prince[.][LF]
Lyon does not know.[.][A][LF]
Something that no one should know.[A][X]

## MSG_D4A
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][FID_Duessel]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][FID_Knoll]
[OpenMidRight]We students of ancient magic, along[.][LF]
with Prince Lyon himself,[.][A][LF]
were researching certain arcane[.][LF]
techniques lost long ago.[.][A][LF]
We were able to reproduce one[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][LF]
phenomenon, but only briefly.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]I should be more concise.[.][A][LF]
Prince Lyon and I pierced the[.][LF]
veil that clouds our futures.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]What? You[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]could see into[LF]
the future?[.][A][LF]
How is that possible? What magic[LF]
is powerful enough to[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]Time is like the water of a river:[LF]
it flows ever on, never stopping.[.][A][LF]
Certain disturbances can cause ripples[LF]
that speed swiftly downstream.[A][LF]
If you can see the water, you can read[LF]
the flow, the ripples, the waves.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]It is possible, General. Possible[.][LF]
and, at times, easy. Just think of it:[A][LF]
If you knew a storm was coming in advance,[LF]
you could evacuate everyone in its way.[.][A][LF]
If you could see what was to come, you[LF]
could help those who might have died.[.][A][LF]
Prince Lyon explained this to us with[.][LF]
much joy in his voice and heart.[A][LF]
His power would, at long last, be able[LF]
to help the citizens of Grado.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]We continued our work. There were[.][LF]
ceremonies, rituals[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]such horrors[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
And then we saw it.[.][A][LF]
In the near future, Grado would be[LF]
ravaged by catastrophe.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]A catastrophe? Do you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]No, it's not the conflict in which[LF]
we are currently embroiled.[.][A][LF]
This event is still in our future.[A][LF]
We saw Grado. We saw the earth[LF]
crumble. We saw our people dying.[.][A][LF]
We saw the shape our future would take.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]What?[.][LF]
That's madness[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Idiocy![.][A][LF]
I've lived a long life, and I've[LF]
never heard of anything like that.[A][LF]
Not ever.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]I am not surprised that you do not[LF]
believe me, General.[A][LF]
We could not believe it, either. We[.][LF]
tried to disprove what we had seen.[.][A][LF]
But nothing could shake the vision.[.][A][LF]
In this disaster, Grado would be[LF]
destroyed. Countless would die.[.][A][LF]
Those who died quickly would be[.][LF]
spared the slow horror of starvation.[.][A][LF]
This was when the emperor died, by the[LF]
way. Lyon was shattered by despair.[.][A][LF]
He devoted himself to research, and[.][LF]
then came the Dark Stone[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]So that's what happened?[A][LF]
Is that when the decision[.][LF]
to invade Renais was made?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I don't know.[.][A][LF]
Only one person knows[.][LF]
the truth behind that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]I have told you only the[LF]
truths I have seen.[.][A][X]

[OpenMidRight]Is that you, General Duessel?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're tired, aren't you?[.][LF]
Worn to the bone.[.][A][LF]
I understand how you feel, but on the[.][LF]
battlefield, this only invites death.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]You are probably right[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
And yet that might be best.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]What are you planning to[LF]
do from here on?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I do not know[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I have lost my way.[.][A][LF]
Perhaps I should have been[LF]
executed in the capital.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]I once studied dark magic[.][LF]
alongside Prince Lyon.[A][LF]
He was such a gentle soul. You could[LF]
see it[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]he was too kind to survive.[.][A][LF]
Prince Lyon dreamt of finding happiness[.][LF]
for all of Grado's citizens.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]And now, Prince Lyon is no more.[A][LF]
I have lost everything.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have also lost everything.[A][LF]
And we have both lost our ways.[.][A][LF]
We are dead men who have stayed[.][LF]
too long away from our graves.[A][LF]
But remember, Knoll[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
You cannot see the future, but you[LF]
can look back at your past.[.][A][LF]
Look and learn. And remember.[.][A][LF]
What gave your life meaning, and what[.][LF]
has taken meaning from you now?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you still hold the convictions that[LF]
guided you in Grado, you can start anew.[A][LF]
That[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]That is what I must do.[.][A][LF]
We may be diminished by our shame, but[LF]
we are not dead yet, my friend.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]General Duessel[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LF]
I am not as strong as you.[A][LF]
Still, [.][ToggleSmile]I believe you are right.[LF]
I, too, shall search for a new path.[A][CR][LF]
[ToggleSmile]A path that guides me to realizing the[LF]
dreams Prince Lyon once held so dear.[.][A][X]
